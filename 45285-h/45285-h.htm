<h2><a name="SCANDINAVIAN_LITERATURE_AND_ANTIQUITIES" id="SCANDINAVIAN_LITERATURE_AND_ANTIQUITIES">SCANDINAVIAN LITERATURE AND ANTIQUITIES.</a></h2>

<p class="center">NUMBER ONE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> predominant taste for the study of ancient literature, and the
investigation of antiquity, has been the means of bringing to light a
vast quantity of matter, which, if written in modern times, would
hardly be regarded of sufficient value to preserve beyond the age
in which it was written. Elegance of style and composition is not
the distinguishing trait in <em>all</em> the Grecian and Roman authors which
have come down to us; nor are the subjects of sufficient importance
to merit a preservation of twenty centuries; although it may be safe
to say, that these qualities in general constitute the beauty and value
of these writings; for we know that the ancients appreciated the
works of their great men, as well as we; and to this we must owe
their preservation. The philosophy of Plato and Socrates&mdash;the
histories of Herodotus and Livy&mdash;the poetry of Homer and Virgil&mdash;the
metaphysics of Aristotle&mdash;the geometry of Euclid, and the eloquence
of Cicero and Demosthenes, are not regarded now with
more esteem than they were in the period in which they were produced,
although the great mass of the people were far behind us in
knowledge. Poetry and eloquence are as attractive to the senses of
a savage, as to him who is civilized; and to this circumstance must be
attributed the preservation and transmission of many poems, of people
who have left no other memento of their existence.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the ancient writers above named, was in advance
of the age in which they lived, yet they were appreciated; and
although kingdoms have risen and fallen, nations have been scattered
and annihilated, and language itself become corrupted or lost, these
memorials of learning and genius have been preserved, amid the general
devastation, and still appear in all their original beauty and
grandeur, more imperishable than the sculptured column or trophied
urn; models for nations yet unborn, and drawing forth the admiration
of the most accomplished scholars and profound philosophers.</p>

<p>In addition to these, we possess many valuable histories, learned
dissertations, poetical effusions, specimens of the early drama, etc.,
which, although they may rank lower in their style of composition,
are valuable from the light they throw upon the manners and customs
of the age in which they were penned, and make us better acquainted
with the private life, the tastes and occupations, of the
ancients.</p>

<p>Thus much may be said of the Greek and Roman people. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
origin, their history, and their literature, are known in all civilized parts
of the world; and from the downfall of their respective kingdoms
to the present time, we are tolerably well acquainted with the leading
events of the history of their descendants, in the modern nations
of the south of Europe. Not so with the Teutonic people, who occupy
the middle and northern parts of that continent. The glory of
their ancestors has never been immortalized; no poet or historian
arose to transmit to posterity an account of their origin, or the fame
of their deeds, as letters were first known to the Goths in A. D., 360.
It is not the intention, in the present essay, to illustrate the literature
of the Germanic nations, but to take up that portion embraced in the
general term of <i>Scandinavian</i>, which embraces the literature of Norway,
Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. It is also known by the term
<i>Old-Northern</i> or <i>Norse</i>, and as <i>Icelandic literature</i>. It is embodied
in the Eddas and Historical Sagas as they are called, in the countries
of the north. The former consists of collections of Icelandic
poems, written upon parchment, or skins, in the language of that
country; and the latter, which include the most important part, are
relations of historical events which have occurred in Iceland and
other countries of the north, including Great Britain and Ireland.
They also extend to the affairs of Greenland, which we know was
colonized by the Scandinavians at an early period, and to accounts
of voyages made by them to an unknown land, called Vinland&mdash;supposed
to be America&mdash;and to various parts of Europe.</p>

<p>Such are the sources of Scandinavian literature. But before we
attempt to examine these treasures, which form the subject of our
remarks, it may be well to ask the question, which naturally arises
here: Who were this ancient people, who, from the earliest period,
have occupied the north of Europe? Whence came they? And to
what nation of more remote antiquity is their origin to be traced?</p>

<p>To answer these questions satisfactorily, would be a task as easily
accomplished, as that of stating with accuracy the origin of the Egyptians.
Several learned writers, of ancient as well as modern times,
have investigated the subject, without arriving at conclusions which
would agree in the most important points; and strange as it may appear,
it is not the less true, that we are better able, after a lapse of
ten or fifteen centuries, to determine the origin of the people by whom
Europe was populated, about the period of the commencement of
the Christian era, than writers were who flourished ten centuries
ago. At that period, the most noble of inventions had not been
brought to light, to treasure up passing events, and what had been
preserved by tradition. Letters were not cultivated in Europe, and
the intercourse between nations of kindred origin was not sufficiently
close, to have promoted such an inquiry.</p>

<p>The cultivation and advancement of the science of philology, or
system of universal grammar, has furnished us with a more unerring
guide by which to trace the origin of the nations of antiquity, where
sufficient of their languages remain, than history itself; for the latter,
being in a great degree traditionary, cannot be relied upon, when
treating of the origin of nations. The primitive history of the Scandinavians,
Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, and Hindoos, are so interwoven
with their mythology, that it is extremely difficult to separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
truth from fiction. In analyzing the various European languages, on
the principles adopted by philologists, we are enabled to trace the
affinities existing between them; and by a similarity of grammatical
structure, correspondence of words and phrases, and analogies in the
conjugations of verbs and declensions of nouns, to classify the various
languages, and ascertain from what family or stock they are derived.
All the living languages of Europe, with the exception of the
Biscayan, or Basque, and the Gaëlic, have been traced to Asia, and to
languages which were spoken by the most ancient people of which
we have any record. It is now conceded, that the Celts were one, if
not the principal, of the primitive nations of Europe, distinguished
by different names in different countries. The earliest historians of
Europe agree, that they were, in a remote period, settled in various
parts of that continent&mdash;in the mountainous regions of the Alps,
and throughout Gaul, whence they migrated to Great Britain and Ireland,
and to the central and western regions of Spain. At a later period,
they inundated Italy, Thrace, and Asia Minor. 'The Hibernians,'
says Malte Brun, 'are an old branch of the same people; and, according
to some authors, the Highlanders of Scotland are a colony of
the native Irish. The <i>Erse</i>, or Gaëlic, is the only authentic monument
of the Celtic language; but it may be readily admitted, that a nation
so widely extended must have been incorporated with many states
whose dialects are at present extinct.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Another primitive nation was the ancestors of the Basques, a people
now dwindled to a few thousands, and confined to the western
base of the Pyrenees. They were closely allied to the Iberians,
who occupied eastern and southern Spain, and a part of Gaul. In
the remnant of this people is preserved one of the most remarkable
languages that philologists have ever yet investigated, exhibiting
undoubted marks of originality. 'It is preserved in a corner of
Europe, the sole remaining fragment of perhaps a hundred dialects,
constructed on the same plan, which probably existed, and were universally
spoken, at a remote period, in that quarter of the globe.
Like the bones of the mammoth, and the shells of unknown fishes,
the races of which have perished, it remains a frightful monument of
the immense destruction produced by a succession of ages. There
it stands, single and alone, of its kind, surrounded by idioms whose
modern construction bears no kind of analogy to it.'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The south of Europe was occupied by the Etruscans, or Etrurians,
whose splendid monuments alone remain to perpetuate their
existence; also by the Ausonians, and the Osci. In the east of
Europe, we know of no other primitive people than the Thracians,
which, however, may have included others of less note. They are
spoken of by all the early historians, but of their language, no traces
are known to exist.</p>

<p>The north of Europe now alone remains. This part of the continent
which embraces Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the north of
Germany, was originally inhabited by the Goths or Scandinavians;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>some writers using the former, and others the latter, to distinguish
them. Under whatever name they have been known, they have
filled so important a place in history, that they deserve more than a
passing notice.</p>

<p>'In the beginning of the sixth century,' says Gibbon, 'and after
the conquest of Italy, the Goths, in the possession of present greatness,
very naturally indulged themselves in the prospect of past and
future glory. They wished to preserve the memory of their ancestors,
and to transmit to posterity their own achievements. The principal
minister of the Court of Ravenna, the learned Cassiodorus,
qualified the inclination of the conquerors in a Gothic history, which
consisted of twelve books, now reduced to the imperfect abridgment
of Jornandes. These writers passed, with the most artful conciseness,
over the misfortunes of the nation, celebrated its success, and
adorned the triumph with many Asiatic trophies, that more properly
belonged to the people of Scythia. On the faith of ancient songs, the
uncertain but the only memorials of barbarians, they deduced the
first origin of the Goths from the vast island or peninsula of Scandinavia.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>No dependence, of course, can be placed on this history, obtained
in such a manner, and by a people unacquainted with letters. Commencing
on historic ground, as early as the Christian era, and as late
as the Antonines, the Goths were established toward the mouth of
the Vistula, and in that fertile province where the commercial cities
of Thorn, Elbing, Köningsberg, and Dantzic, were long afterward
founded. In the reign of Antonines, the Goths were still seated in
Prussia. About the reign of Alexander Severus, the Roman province
of Dacia had already experienced their proximity, by frequent
and destructive inroads. In this interval, therefore, of about seventy
years, Gibbon places the second migration of the Goths from the
Baltic to the Euxine.</p>

<p>Another, and perhaps a more plausible theory, for the origin of the
Goths, is that of identifying them with the Thracians. This theory
is strongly advocated by Vans Kennedy, who adduces many and conclusive
arguments in favor of his hypothesis. Then to identify the
Scandinavians with the Goths, and their origin is settled. From
the time of Herodotus, until the general prevalence of the name
of Goths, it is undeniable, that the Thracians remained unconquered,
and that they extended themselves from Macedonia to
the Dniester, and from the Euxine Sea to the confines of Germany.
For, as the Getæ are identified by ancient writers with the
Thracians, and as neither proof nor probability supports the assumption
that Thracia was ever occupied by either Scythians or Scandinavians,
it must necessarily follow, that whatever is predicated of the
Getæ, must equally apply to the Thracians; and, consequently, if the
Getæ were Goths, the Goths were also Thracians. To determine,
therefore, the identity of the Getæ and Goths, it may be remarked,
that from Strabo, it appears that the country immediately to the south
of the Elbe was inhabited by the Suevi; then succeeded the country
of the Getæ, which extended along the southern bank of the Danube,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and also to the north of that river, as far as the Dniester. The M&oelig;si,
likewise, dwelt on both banks of the Danube, and were equally with
the Getæ considered by the Greeks to be a Thracian people. The
Dacians, also, were a Thracian people.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It will be necessary, in the next place, to identify the other nations
which occupied the interior of Europe from the second to the fifth
century, with one of the great nations before alluded to, in order to
arrive at the point in question. The incursions made by the barbarians,
as they were called, from the North into Italy, which eventuated
in the overthrow of the Roman empire, have generally been
attributed to people who crossed the Baltic into Denmark, thence
into Germany, where, uniting with other tribes, they concentrated
their power, and established an empire between the Euxine and
Adriatic, on both sides of the Danube. The most distinguished of
these German nations, as they were called, were the Goths, Vandals,
Visigoths, and Gepidæ. 'In ancient times,' says Procopius, 'they
were called Sauromatæ and Melanchlæri, and by some the Gætic
nation. They thus differ from each other in name, but in nothing
else; for they are all fair, yellow-haired, and good-looking; they
observe the same institutions, and worship the same God, as they
are all of the Arian sect; and they use the same language, which
is called Gothic. It therefore appears to me, that they were all
originally the same nation.'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The affinities of language which are so apparent in the languages
of the north of Europe and Germany, as well as in Great Britain,
do not require any evidence to prove their identity of origin; and
if their language was the same, the natural conclusion is, that the
people were the same. Gibbon states, that the German nations originally
emigrated from Scandinavia; but his authority was Jornandes,
who abridged the history of the Goths, as written by Cassiodorus,
before alluded to, which is considered as indifferent
authority.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the Goths and Scandinavians to be the same, one
originated in the other, or each, migrating from the parent stock,
must have taken a different course to reach their respective countries.
The latter must necessarily have passed around the Gulf of Bothnia
to reach Sweden and Norway, or must have passed to the south
of the Baltic, through the country of the Goths. The former course
is altogether improbable, and the latter makes them a branch of the
Gothic nation, which is far the most probable. After quoting numerous
authors on this subject, Vans Kennedy comes to the conclusion,
that from the Hellespont the Thracians gradually extended themselves
to the shores of the Baltic, and thence to Scandinavia. This
hypothesis is far the most reasonable, inasmuch as it has support
from the analogies of languages; from a close resemblance in the
complexion, color of hair, eyes, etc., and from the testimony of history
itself. The Thracians, as before observed, were one of the
primitive nations of Europe. They are repeatedly noticed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>Homer, who speaks of them as a numerous and hardy race. Alluding
to their country, he says:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'To where the Mysians prove their martial force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renown'd for justice and for length of days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice happy race!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Iliad, b. xiii.</span>, v. 1, p. 13.</p>

<p>They are afterward spoken of by Herodotus, and subsequently by
Procopius, from the latter of which we have quoted. As a nation,
the Thracians have long been extinct. Even of their language
there remains no vestige, except what is seen in the Teutonic languages
at the North; those of the South, of Pelargic origin, are by
some philologists derived from the Thracian, inasmuch as the affinities
of the languages of the north and south of Europe are sufficient
to deduce them from some earlier language, all traces of which
are extinct.</p>

<p>This subject might be carried much farther, by tracing the analogies
of language which exist between the German and Sanscrit,
or between the English and Sanscrit, and of the affinity between
the Persian and the two European languages named. They are all
so striking as to place it beyond a doubt that some connexion existed
at a very remote period of antiquity, between the people by whom
these languages are spoken. On this point, the great philologist
Adelung observes, that it has excited the greatest wonder and astonishment.
'The fact is undeniable; and the German found in Persian
consists not only of a remarkable number of radical words, but also
in particles, and is even observable in the grammatical structure.
This circumstance will admit of two explanations, either from a
later intermingling of the two languages, after they were completely
formed, or from their both being derived from the same mother
tongue.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Having thus traced the Scandinavians to the Thracians, which
latter people, from their proximity to Asia, must have preserved
parts of their mother tongue, particularly if that was the Persian or
Zend, and noticed the remarkable affinity existing, even in our day,
in the languages of Teutonic people (of which the Scandinavians
are one) and the Persian, the antiquity of the former, and their
descent from one of the original nations of Asia, will be sufficiently
apparent, to take up the subject which heads this article.</p>

<p>The early history of the North was traditionary, until the introduction
of Christianity, with which Roman letters were also introduced.
These were easily adapted to express the various sounds
of their languages; and being much more convenient and applicable
to reduce their songs, tales, and histories into, than the characters
heretofore used, they were soon after embodied in them. The
letters in use, previous to the introduction of the Roman alphabet,
were Runic. This alphabet consisted of sixteen letters, which are
said to be Ph&oelig;nician in their origin, and to have been introduced by
Odin. They were used to sculpture important events on rocks and
monuments, many of which are still found in various parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>North, as well as in Great Britain. In another place, a more particular
account will be given of these <i>Runes</i>, as they are called, accompanied
by translations.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the Runic letters had ever been employed
to much extent, on parchment, to record passing events, or to preserve
the lays, which memory alone had transmitted from generation
to generation. Like all other people of antiquity, the Scandinavians
had their bards, synonymous with the rhapsodists of Greece. They
were known by the name of <i>Skalds</i>, and were both poets and historians.
'They were the companions and chroniclers of kings, who
liberally rewarded their genius, and sometimes entered the lists with
them in trials of skill in their own art. A regular succession of this
order of men was perpetuated&mdash;a list of two hundred and thirty
in number, of the most distinguished in the three kingdoms of Norway,
Denmark, and Sweden, among whom are several crowned
heads, and distinguished warriors of the heroic age. Canute the
Great retained several Skalds at his court, among whom was one
from Iceland, 'who,' says Snorre Sturleson, 'having composed a
short poem on Canute, went, for the purpose of reciting it, to the
king, who was just rising from table, and thronged with suitors.
The impatient poet craved an audience from the king for his lay,
assuring him that it was very short. The wrath of Canute was kindled,
and he answered the Skald with a stern look: 'Are you not ashamed
to do what none but yourself has dared&mdash;to write a <em>short</em> poem
upon me? Unless, by the hour of dinner to-morrow, you produce
a <em>drapa</em>, above thirty strophes long, on the same subject, your life
shall pay the penalty.' The inventive genius of the poet did not
desert him. He produced the required poem, and was liberally
rewarded by the king with fifty marks of silver.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The improvisatores
of modern times forcibly remind us of the northern Skalds, who,
without the genial skies and classic land of Italy to excite their imagination,
produced their lays with equal facility, and expressed their
ideas, which correspond with the wildness and rigidity of the North,
as the Italian bards assimilate their effusions with the mildness of
their climate, and the delightful landscapes with which they were
surrounded. Southey thus alludes to them:</p>

<p>The most important part of Old Northern, or Icelandic literature,
is that contained in the <i>Sagas</i>. Of these there are vast quantities
still in a high state of preservation, not less than two thousand of
them being in the collection of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries.
They are written upon skins, in dialects of the Scandinavian
languages. The greater portion, however, are in the Icelandic
text; others are in the Faroe, Orkney, and Norwegian dialects.
One of the most noble and praiseworthy undertakings of the present
day, is that of the society alluded to, which contemplates the examination,
elucidation, and immediate publication, of these valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
manuscripts. They have already advanced to a considerable extent
in the accomplishment of their object. The first and most important
collection of the Saga manuscripts, was that made by Arne Magnusen,
a learned Icelander, who died in 1730. He collected one thousand
five hundred and fifty-four of them, and by his will bequeathed
a large sum for their publication. This fund led Professor Rafn, in
connection with Brynjulfon, Egilson, and Gudmunsson, of Iceland,
to found a society for the publication of the old Norse manuscripts,
which society is the one referred to, having the King of Denmark
for its patron and founder, and embracing among its members most
of the learned men of the north of Europe. In addition to the
bequest of Arne Magnusen, a large fund has been formed, contributed
by the king and other noble and public-spirited individuals of
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Great Britain, and Iceland,
for the further prosecution and investigation of old northern Archaeology,
and Scandinavian antiquities generally. 'The ancient literature
of the North,' to quote the language of a letter from the
society, 'in point of extent, has not without reason been compared
to the literary remains of Greece and Latium, and which is indisputably
of decided importance to the antiquarians, historians, lawyers,
and philologists of Europe and America.' It is gratifying to observe,
that this enterprise has already begun to excite an interest, not only
within the limited territory of Denmark, or of Scandinavia, where
the resources for so extensive an undertaking are too scanty, but
also in several countries beyond the limits of northern Europe,
whose scholars share with us in the sentiment, that such literary
undertakings ought not to be confined within political boundaries,
but, on account of their extensive tendency, have also a claim to
active participation from other countries; since without it they cannot
meet with the requisite development, nor become of that utility
to literature and science for which they are intended, and of which
they are susceptible. In order more fully to carry into effect the
plans of this society, the cöoperation of several of the most eminent
antiquarians and literary men of Great Britain and the United States
has been solicited, to which they will, no doubt, readily accede.</p>

<p>The Saga literature, which was cultivated to so great an extent in
that distant and isolated spot, while all Europe was in a state of
darkness, had a great influence in civilizing and promoting the cultivation
of letters throughout the north of Europe. The Icelanders
were a maritime people, inheriting their love of commerce and
adventure from the hardy Scandinavians who planted their colony.
Their continued intercourse with the coast of Norway led them to
seek adventures elsewhere. The Faroe Islands, the Orkneys, Great
Britain, and Ireland, were visited, and a continued trade kept up
between them. The two former were Scandinavian colonies, and
spoke a dialect of the ancient language.</p>

<p>With the introduction of Christianity into the North, the later
Latins, Gothic characters of the Anglo-Saxons, came into general
use; and to this we owe the transcripts, made chiefly in Ireland, of
the sagas and poetry of the pagan times of the North, and also of
the northern history during the middle ages. These sagas are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
divided into four classes, the mythic, mythico-historical, historical,
and romantic.</p>

<p>The volumes already published, are the following: Foramanna
Sögur, eleven volumes; Oldnordiske Sagær, eleven volumes; Scripita
Historica Islandorum, six volumes. These contain historical
sagas, recording events which transpired on the continent; a history
of the Norwegian kings from Olaf Fryggvuson to Magnus, Lagabæta,
embracing a long period of years, and terminating in the
year 1274; the history of the Danish kings, from Harold Bluetooth
to Canute VI., or the period between the middle of the tenth
and the commencement of the thirteenth centuries, with critical notes
and commentaries on the narrations and sagas of several northern
writers.</p>

<p><i>Iselendinga Sögur</i>, two volumes, contains the historical sagas,
recording events which have transpired in Iceland; giving also a
particular account of the first colonization of the island, in Icelandic.</p>

<p><i>Faëreyinga Saga</i>, or the History of the Inhabitants of the Faroe
Islands; in Icelandic, the Faroe-dialect, and Danish. <i>Fornaldar
Sögur Nordrlanda</i>, three volumes; <i>Nordiske Fortids Sagær</i>, three
volumes. The latter six volumes comprise all the <i>mytho-historical
sagas</i>, recording events in the North, assignable to the period anterior
to the colonization of Iceland, or the era of authentic history;
in Icelandic and Danish.</p>

<p><i>Krakumal sive Epicedium Ragnaris Lodbroci</i>, or Ode on the Heroic
Deeds and Death of the Danish King, Ragnar Lodbrok, in England;
in Icelandic, Danish, Latin, and French.</p>

<p>These publications will give some idea of the extent, variety, and
interest, of the manuscripts in the possession of this society, and of
the light which, in all probability, many of them will throw upon the
hitherto unsettled points of English, Scottish, and Irish history.</p>

<h2><a name="EDWARD_FANES_ROSEBUD" id="EDWARD_FANES_ROSEBUD">EDWARD FANE'S ROSEBUD.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is hardly a more difficult exercise of fancy, than, while
gazing at a figure of melancholy age, to re-create its youth, and,
without entirely obliterating the identity of form and features, to restore
those graces which time has snatched away. Some old people,
especially women, so age-worn and woful are they, seem never to
have been young and gay. It is easier to conceive that such gloomy
phantoms were sent into the world as withered and decrepit as we
beheld them now, with sympathies only for pain and grief, to watch
at death-beds, and weep at funerals. Even the sable garments of
their widowhood appear essential to their existence; all their attributes
combine to render them darksome shadows, creeping strangely
amid the sunshine of human life. Yet it is no unprofitable task, to
take one of these doleful creatures, and set fancy resolutely at work
to brighten the dim eye, and darken the silvery locks, and paint the
ashen-cheek with rose-color, and repair the shrunken and crazy form,
till a dewy maiden shall be seen in the old matron's elbow-chair.
The miracle being wrought, then let the years roll back again, each
sadder than the last, and the whole weight of age and sorrow settle
down upon the youthful figure. Wrinkles and furrows, the hand-writing
of Time, may thus be deciphered, and found to contain deep
lessons of thought and feeling. Such profit might be derived, by a
skilful observer, from my much-respected friend, the Widow Ingersoll,
a nurse of great repute, who has breathed the atmosphere of
sick-chambers and dying-breaths, these forty years.</p>

<p>See! she sits cowering over her lonesome hearth, with her gown
and upper petticoat drawn upward, gathering thriftily into her person
the whole warmth of the fire, which, now at nightfall, begins to
dissipate the autumnal chill of her chamber. The blaze quivers capriciously
in front, alternately glimmering into the deepest chasms
of her wrinkled visage, and then permitting a ghostly dimness to
mar the outlines of her venerable figure. And Nurse Ingersoll holds
a tea-spoon in her right hand, with which to stir up the contents of a
tumbler in her left, whence steams a vapory fragrance, abhorred of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
temperance societies. Now she sips&mdash;now stirs&mdash;now sips again.
Her sad old heart has need to be revived by the rich infusion of Geneva,
which is mixed half-and-half with hot water, in the tumbler.
All day long she has been sitting by a death-pillow, and quitted it for
her home, only when the spirit of her patient left the clay, and went
homeward too. But now are her melancholy meditations cheered,
and her torpid blood warmed, and her shoulders lightened of at least
twenty ponderous years, by a draught from the true Fountain of
Youth, in a case-bottle. It is strange that men should deem that
fount a fable, when its liquor fills more bottles than the congress-water!
Sip it again, good nurse, and see whether a second draught
will not take off another score of years, and perhaps ten more, and
show us, in your high-backed chair, the blooming damsel who plighted
troths with Edward Fane. Get you gone, Age and Widowhood!
Come back, unwedded Youth! But, alas! the charm will not work.
In spite of fancy's most potent spell, I can see only an old dame
cowering over the fire, a picture of decay and desolation, while the
November blast roars at her in the chimney, and fitful showers rush
suddenly against the window.</p>

<p>Yet there was a time when Rose Grafton&mdash;such was the pretty
maiden-name of Nurse Ingersoll&mdash;possessed beauty that would have
gladdened this dim and dismal chamber, as with sunshine. It won
for her the heart of Edward Fane, who has since made so great a
figure in the world, and is now a grand old gentleman, with powdered
hair, and as gouty as a lord. These early lovers thought to have
walked hand in hand through life. They had wept together for Edward's
little sister Mary, whom Rose tended in her sickness, partly
because she was the sweetest child that ever lived or died, but more
for love of him. She was but three years old. Being such an infant,
Death could not embody his terrors in her little corpse; nor
did Rose fear to touch the dead child's brow, though chill, as she
curled the silken hair around it, nor to take her tiny hand, and clasp a
flower within its fingers. Afterward, when she looked through the
pane of glass in the coffin-lid, and beheld Mary's face, it seemed not
so much like death, or life, as like a wax-work, wrought into the
perfect image of a child asleep, and dreaming of its mother's smile.
Rose thought her too fair a thing to be hidden in the grave, and wondered
that an angel did not snatch up little Mary's coffin, and bear
the slumbering babe to heaven, and bid her wake immortal. But
when the sods were laid on little Mary, the heart of Rose was troubled.
She shuddered at the fantasy, that, in grasping the child's cold
fingers, her virgin hand had exchanged a first greeting with mortality,
and could never lose the earthy taint. How many a greeting since!
But as yet, she was a fair young girl, with the dew-drops of fresh
feeling in her bosom; and instead of Rose, which seemed too mature
a name for her half-opened beauty, her lover called her
Rosebud.</p>

<p>The rosebud was destined never to bloom for Edward Fane. His
mother was a rich and haughty dame, with all the aristocratic prejudices
of colonial times. She scorned Rose Grafton's humble parentage,
and caused her son to break his faith, though, had she let
him choose, he would have prized his Rosebud above the richest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
diamond. The lovers parted, and have seldom met again. Both
may have visited the same mansions, but not at the same time; for
one was bidden to the festal hall, and the other to the sick-chamber;
he was the guest of Pleasure and Prosperity, and she of Anguish.
Rose, after their separation, was long secluded within the dwelling
of Mr. Ingersoll, whom she married with the revengeful hope of
breaking her false lover's heart. She went to her bridegroom's
arms with bitterer tears, they say, than young girls ought to shed, at
the threshold of the bridal chamber. Yet, though her husband's
head was getting gray, and his heart had been chilled with an autumnal
frost, Rose soon began to love him, and wondered at her own
conjugal affection. He was all she had to love; there were no
children.</p>

<p>In a year or two, poor Mr. Ingersoll was visited with a wearisome
infirmity, which settled in his joints, and made him weaker than a
child. He crept forth about his business, and came home at dinnertime
and eventide, not with the manly tread that gladdens a wife's
heart, but slowly&mdash;feebly&mdash;jotting down each dull footstep with a
melancholy dub of his staff. We must pardon his pretty wife, if she
sometimes blushed to own him. Her visitors, when they heard him
coming, looked for the appearance of some old, old man; but he
dragged his nerveless limbs into the parlor&mdash;and there was Mr. Ingersoll!
The disease increasing, he never went into the sunshine,
save with a staff in his right hand, and his left on his wife's shoulder,
bearing heavily downward, like a dead man's hand. Thus, a slender
woman, still looking maiden-like, she supported his tall, broad-chested
frame along the pathway of their little garden, and plucked
the roses for her gray-haired husband, and spoke soothingly, as to an
infant. His mind was palsied with his body; its utmost energy was
peevishness. In a few months more, she helped him up the staircase,
with a pause at every step, and a longer one upon the landing-place,
and a heavy glance behind, as he crossed the threshold of his
chamber. He knew, poor man, that the precincts of those four
walls would thenceforth be his world&mdash;his world, his home, his
tomb&mdash;at once a dwelling and a burial-place, till he were borne to
a darker and a narrower one. But Rose was with him in the tomb.
He leaned upon her, in his daily passage from the bed to the chair
by the fireside, and back again from the weary chair to the joyless
bed&mdash;his bed and hers&mdash;their marriage-bed; till even this short
journey ceased, and his head lay all day upon the pillow, and hers
all night beside it. How long poor Mr. Ingersoll was kept in
misery! Death seemed to draw near the door, and often to lift the
latch, and sometimes to thrust his ugly skull into the chamber, nodding
to Rose, and pointing at her husband, but still delayed to enter.
'This bed-ridden wretch cannot escape me!' quoth Death. 'I will
go forth, and run a race with the swift, and fight a battle with the
strong, and come back for Ingersoll at my leisure!' Oh, when the
deliverer came so near, in the dull anguish of her worn-out sympathies,
did she never long to cry, 'Death, come in!'</p>

<p>But, no! We have no right to ascribe such a wish to our friend
Rose. She never failed in a wife's duty to her poor sick husband.
She murmured not, though a glimpse of the sunny sky was as strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to her as him, nor answered peevishly, though his complaining accents
roused her from her sweetest dream, only to share his wretchedness.
He knew her faith, yet nourished a cankered jealousy; and when the
slow disease had chilled all his heart, save one lukewarm spot, which
Death's frozen fingers were searching for, his last words were: 'What
would my Rose have done for her first love, if she has been so true
and kind to a sick old man like me!' And then his poor soul crept
away, and left the body lifeless, though hardly more so than for years
before, and Rose a widow, though in truth it was the wedding night
that widowed her. She felt glad, it must be owned, when Mr. Ingersoll
was buried, because his corpse had retained such a likeness to
the man half alive, that she hearkened for the sad murmur of his
voice, bidding her shift his pillow. But all through the next winter,
though the grave had held him many a month, she fancied him calling
from that cold bed, 'Rose! Rose! come put a blanket on my
feet!'</p>

<p>So now the Rosebud was the Widow Ingersoll. Her troubles had
come early, and, tedious as they seemed, had passed before all her
bloom was fled. She was still fair enough to captivate a bachelor,
or, with a widow's cheerful gravity, she might have won a widower,
stealing into his heart in the very guise of his dead wife. But the
Widow Ingersoll had no such projects. By her watchings and continual
cares, her heart had become knit to her first husband with a
constancy which changed its very nature, and made her love him for
his infirmities, and infirmity for his sake. When the palsied old man
was gone, even her early lover could not have supplied his place.
She had dwelt in a sick-chamber, and been the companion of a half-dead
wretch, till she should scarcely breathe in a free air, and felt
ill at ease with the healthy and the happy. She missed the fragrance
of the doctor's stuff. She walked the chamber with a noiseless footfall.
If visitors came in, she spoke in soft and soothing accents, and
was startled and shocked by their loud voices. Often, in the lonesome
evening, she looked timorously from the fireside to the bed,
with almost a hope of recognising a ghastly face upon the pillow.
Then went her thoughts sadly to her husband's grave. If one impatient
throb had wronged him in his lifetime&mdash;if she had secretly
repined, because her buoyant youth was imprisoned with his torpid
age&mdash;if ever, while slumbering beside him, a treacherous dream
had admitted another into her heart&mdash;yet the sick man had been
preparing a revenge, which the dead now claimed. On his painful
pillow, he had cast a spell around her; his groans and misery had
proved more captivating charms than gayety and youthful grace; in
his semblance, Disease itself had won the Rosebud for a bride;
nor could his death dissolve the nuptials. By that indissoluble bond
she had gained a home in every sick-chamber, and nowhere else;
there were her brethren and sisters; thither her husband summoned
her, with that voice which had seemed to issue from the grave of
Ingersoll. At length she recognised her destiny.</p>

<p>We have beheld her as the maid, the wife, the widow; now we
see her in a separate and insulated character: she was, in all her
attributes, Nurse Ingersoll. And Nurse Ingersoll alone, with her
own shrivelled lips, could make known her experience in that capacity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
What a history might she record of the great sicknesses, in
which she has gone hand in hand with the exterminating angel!
She remembers when the small-pox hoisted a red-banner on almost
every house along the street. She has witnessed when the typhus
fever swept off a whole household, young and old, all but a lonely
mother, who vainly shrieked to follow her last loved one. Where
would be Death's triumph, if none lived to weep! She can speak
of strange maladies that have broken out, as if spontaneously, but
were found to have been imported from foreign lands, with rich silks
and other merchandise, the costliest portion of the cargo. And
once, she recollects, the people died of what was considered a new
pestilence, till the doctors traced it to the ancient grave of a young
girl, who thus caused many deaths a hundred years after her own
burial. Strange that such black mischief should lurk in a maiden's
grave! She loves to tell how strong men fight with fiëry fevers,
utterly refusing to give up their breath; and how consumptive virgins
fade out of the world, scarcely reluctant, as if their lovers were
wooing them to a far country. Tell us, thou fearful woman! tell
us the death-secrets! Fain would I search out the meaning of words,
faintly gasped with intermingled sobs, and broken sentences, half-audibly
spoken between earth and the judgment-seat!</p>

<p>An awful woman! She is the patron-saint of young physicians,
and the bosom friend of old ones. In the mansions where she enters,
the inmates provide themselves black garments; the coffin-maker
follows her; and the bell tolls as she comes away from the threshold.
Death himself has met her at so many a bed-side, that he puts forth
his bony hand to greet Nurse Ingersoll. She is an awful woman!
And, oh! is it conceivable, that this handmaid of human infirmity
and affliction&mdash;so darkly stained, so thoroughly imbued with all that
is saddest in the doom of mortals&mdash;can ever again be bright and
gladsome, even though bathed in the sunshine of eternity? By her
long communion with wo, has she not forfeited her inheritance of
immortal joy? Does any germ of bliss survive within her?</p>

<p>Hark! an eager knocking at Nurse Ingersoll's door. She starts
from her drowsy reverie, sets aside the empty tumbler and tea-spoon,
and lights a lamp at the dim embers of the fire. Rap, rap, rap!
again; and she hurries adown the staircase, wondering which of her
friends can be at death's door now, since there is such an earnest
messenger at Nurse Ingersoll's. Again the peal resounds, just as
her hand is on the lock. 'Be quick, Nurse Ingersoll!' cries a man
on the door-step; 'old Colonel Fane is taken with the gout in his
stomach, and has sent for you to watch by his death-bed. Make
haste, for there is no time to lose!' 'Fane! Edward Fane! And
has he sent for me at last? I am ready! I will get on my cloak
and begone. So,' adds the sable-gowned, ashen-visaged, funereal old
figure, 'Edward Fane remembers his Rosebud!'</p>

<p>Our question is answered. There is a germ of bliss within her.
Her long-hoarded constancy&mdash;her memory of the bliss that was&mdash;remaining
amid the gloom of her after life, like a sweet-smelling
flower in a coffin, is a symbol that all may be renewed. In some
happier clime, the Rosebud may revive again, with all the dew-drops
in its bosom.</p>

<h2><a name="MARK" id="MARK">MARK!</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY PATER ABRAHAM A SANCTA CLARA.</p>

<p class="p2 center">IN TWO PARTS&mdash;PART ONE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A writer</span> in Blackwood, in reviewing the poems of Bishop Corbet,
of facetious memory, insists that the church has been more distinguished
for wit and humor, than any other of the learned professions.
This may not hold true in these refined days, and especially with
us, where the strength of a man's principles is apt to be measured by
the length of his face, and where a large portion of the community
seem to think that</p>

<p class="center">
'To laugh were want of goodness, and grimace.'<br />
</p>

<p>But it was not so in the time of Corbet, of South, of Swift, and of
Sterne. Even in the present day, the name of Sydney Smith is identical
with a grin, and evangelical old Rowland Hill himself could
not keep down the busy devil of fun within him. But these are only
exceptions. The taste of the age has declared itself, rightly enough,
perhaps, against the mixture of things sacred and jocose; and the
clergyman who is so unfortunate as to possess a fund of wit, must
seek some other field for its display than the desk, happy if he be
allowed to indulge it even in private, without a brotherly hint from
that benevolent class of individuals, whose chief business in life is
to attend to the foibles of their neighbors. To the student, however,
it is a treat, to turn aside from the staid formality and correct dulness
of the present age, to the times when it was permitted to a man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
follow the bent of his genius, however devious; when illiterate audiences,
more filled with the spirit of faith than with that of criticism,
were as much edified by their preacher's jokes as by his homilies;
and when even the good man, dreaming as little as Shakspeare himself
that his tragi-comedy would fall under the ban of posterity, went
on, firing off alternately the heavy ordnance of learned denunciation,
and the lighter artillery of jest and jibe, at the head of the conscience-stricken
sinner.</p>

<p>Our business, however, is not with the English worthies of this
school, with whose merits and defects we are sufficiently familiar, but
to introduce the reader to another genius of the same stamp, who
flourished at Vienna, where he held no less a station than that of
preacher at the emperor's court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pater Abraham a Sancta Clara</span>, if we regard only his quaintness,
his queerness, his bad puns, and his jokes, lugged in, like Sancho's
proverbs, in season and out of season, was a lineal descendant of those
worthy travelling friars, whom Schiller has immortalized by the
Capuchin's Sermon, in the introduction to Wallenstein. But in
learning, in fervor, in rough and rude but stirring eloquence, he is
far above the herd of hedge-preachers. 'Though it appear a little out
of fashion,' there is much that is sterling in him. Few court preachers
ever spake so freely and fearlessly, or applied the lash of satire so
unsparingly to every rank and condition. Had he lived in a more
refined age, when cultivation might have chastened without destroying
his fancy, he would have stood high among popular orators.</p>

<p>His name is probably new to most of our readers; for few of
our German scholars ever peep into those ponderous folios in which
earlier days delighted, or trace up the stream of German literature
higher than Wieland or Klopstock. To such, it would be idle to
expatiate on the crabbed beauties which adorn the Nibelungen-lied,
the Minnesingers, old Hans Sachs, or Abraham a Sancta Clara. We
trust, however, that in the latter they will find enough of oddity, at
least, to render some slight acquaintance acceptable. His true name
was <span class="smcap">Ulrich Megerle</span>, and he was born in Suabia, (the Ireland of
Germany,) in 1642. At the age of twenty, he became a bare-footed
monk, of the Augustine order, and in 1669, was invited to Vienna, in
the capacity of court preacher, an office he filled till his death, in
1709; preaching and writing the while with untiring zeal and industry.
At a future time, we may brush the learned dust off some other
volumes of his works: at present, we will take up one of his choicest
bits of quaintness, the discourse called '<i>Mark!</i>' composed of a
series of warnings to the people of Vienna, written soon after the
plague, which swept off seventy thousand inhabitants in six months.
We have been obliged, of course, to take some few liberties in our
version. Where one of his bad German puns proved utterly untranslateable,
we have endeavored to fill its place with an English one,
equally as bad, and as near the original as possible. It will be seen
that here and there he varies the steady progress of his prose, and
breaks into a rhyming pace, something between a canter and a hobble;
showing that the amphibious measure adopted by the 'wondrous
boy that wrote Alroy,' is not altogether original. Without
farther preface, we shall proceed to our extracts. Thus, then, discourseth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
our reverend friend, in his exordium, of the signs that, as
usual, preceded the pestilence:</p>

<p>'Signs in the heavens were furnished by the baleful and malevolent
aspects of the planets. Signs in air are usually changeful weather,
and heavy rains. Clouds, too, are so deemed; but in my poor judgment,
the plague was caused, not only by unwholesome <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nebulæ</i>, but
by wicked <i>nebulones</i>. Signs of water are, abundance of fishes cast on
shore, crabs, frogs, and toads; and it is certain, when sharks are
found plying round courts of justice, when honesty sidles off like a
crab, and when toadies are found in the high places, that God commonly
sends a pestilence. Signs of earth, are, when idle, noxious
weeds and herbs infest the ground; and of a surety, when such plants
as sanguinary, dandy-lions, mushrooms, and painted-ladies, grow plentifully,
it is easy to see what is meant thereby!' * * *</p>

<p>'Death began his career in Leopoldstadt, (the suburbs,) and there
destroyed the people for a time, but in moderation. Afterward the
pestilence crossed the Danube to the other suburbs; and it seemed
at first as though Death ventured not to enter the capital, but would
content himself with the suburbs, and the dark corners, and dirty
spots thereof; so that men began wickedly to surmise, that he only
wanted to pick out the refuse, to rummage beggars' wallets, and still
his hunger with coarse crumbs; and that noble palaces, and rich
houses, were safe from his scythe. 'Holla!' said Death, 'to let you
know that no fortress is too strong for me, if girt with a fosse that
could swallow the ocean, I will, spite of you all, conquer the city!'
And he actually did in July.</p>

<p>'In the days of the dictator, Cæsar, an ox spoke; in the days of
the prophet Balaam, an ass spoke; in the time of the Emperor
Maurice, a metal image spoke; in the time of Beda, the stones
spoke; but at this time, in Vienna, when a sick man lay here in one
corner, a dying man groaned there in the other; a few steps off lay
one already dead, and the bodies choked the way of the passers-by;
in Vienna, the very stones spake, and warned the people to repentance.
'Up, and awake, ye sinners! The axe is laid to the root of
the tree! God's anger is at the threshold; the voice of the Almighty
is calling you to eternity; the archangel Michael holds the balance,
to weigh your life! Up! up! and repent, for this is the only prop
to which to hold fast in the day of destruction! The penitent knockings
of your heart, be sure, can alone open the door of heaven;
your hearty sighs are the only music that please the ear of God.'
Thus spake all the streets and alleys, and the plastermen trod on,
warned them to seek a plaster for the wounds of their conscience.</p>

<p>'Taverns are wont to be the abode of joy and license; for it is no
secret, that when the blessed Virgin came to Bethlehem with Joseph,
she had to take shelter in a broken stall, for there was no room
for her in the tavern; and it is a truth, that God seldom finds
any room in such houses, because all things evil lodge there.
For a lamb to become a hog, an eagle a crow, and a horse an ass, is
no great miracle; for do we not see daily, that men drink like hogs
at the 'White Lamb;' that the 'Golden Eagle' makes gallows-birds,
and the 'Red-Horse' asses? But in these days, the reverse happened;
and the waiters were not so busy in counting up the drinks, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the drinkers, who lay dead by the door the next morning. Their
floors were sprinkled, not with water, but with tears. Instead of
shouting, was sighing, and&mdash;wonderful to say!&mdash;there was more
whining in them than wine.'</p>

<p>After discoursing in this manner concerning the plague and its incidents,
by way of prologue, he proceeds to his practical deductions,
addressed to all classes: and first, he invokes mankind generally,
heading the invocation,</p>

<p class="center">
'MARK&mdash;MAN!'<br />
</p>

<p>''Tis not for nothing, that the word <em>live</em>, spelled backward, readeth
<em>evil</em>. 'Tis like a cloud, that fantastic child of the summer, which is
no sooner born, than the rays of the sun menace to make an end of
him. Just so our life, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vix orimur morimur</i>! Our first breath is a sigh
on the way to death, and the very rocking of the cradle warns us how
tottering is our existence.' * * * 'Summer comes
after spring; Saturday comes after Friday; four comes after three,
and death comes after life.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Life and glass, they shake and they break;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life and grass, how soon they pass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life and a hare, how fleet they are!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Life is certain only in uncertainty, and is like a leaf on the tree,
a foam on the sea, a wave on the strand, a house on the sand.'</p>

<p>'Stop me not, while I sing my song before thy door. To-day red,
to-morrow dead; to-day your grace, to-morrow, 'God be gracious;'
to-day, a comfort to all, to-morrow, under the pall; to-day, dear,
to-morrow, the bier; to-day hurra, to-morrow, psha!</p>

<p>'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnes morimur!</i> I have seen that we must all die; I have seen
that death is a player, and a roguish one, for he bowls the men down
and setteth them not up again, and attacketh not the pawn alone, but
the king; I have seen, that were I to gather together the limbs of a
dead emperor, and mix them up with water, they would not be of
size enough to stop the mouth of sneering Michal, when she opened
it to laugh at David her lord.</p>

<p>'Joshua, the hero, before he stormed the city of Jericho, made a
vow to the Lord that none of his army should plunder aught. God
knows, it's hard for soldiers to keep from it; and though they have
little to do with schools, they know wondrous well, that in default of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dativus</i>, they must take to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ablativus</i>. Yet, spite of the ordinance,
a soldier named Achan crooked his fingers, and helped himself
to the booty. And lo! when he was caught, and brought before
the aforesaid hero, what answered he: '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abstuli, abscondi in terrâ, et
fossam humo aperui</i>.' Such is the answer of Death, the great robber
and plunderer of all things. Tell me, Death, where are Matthias the
Emperor, and Matathias, the prophet? Where are Eleazer and
Eliezer? Where are Leo and Leontius, Maximus and Maximinus?
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abstuti et abscondi in terrâ</i>,' says Death!'</p>

<p>The Pater next takes up the religious world, commencing, as usual,
'Mark! Sir Priest!' and dilateth on the importance of the office, as
follows:</p>

<p>'What is worthier than pious and spiritual men, who have turned
their backs on the world, knowing that world and wild are words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
that differ little in name, and none in fact. For what is this world,
but a garden full of thistles; a sugared poison, a gilded dung-hill; a
sack full of holes; a silver hook, a shop full of fool's-caps; a drug-store,
full of nauseous purges; a flowery deceit? The apostles
likened the kingdom of God to a grain of mustard-seed, not to a
sugar-plum; to sour leaven, and not to sweet-meats.'</p>

<p>After reminding us that Peter, in the fulness of his zeal, smote off
the high priest's servant's ear, and was reproved therefor, he goes on
to give a reason for it, which we do not recollect to have met in any
of the commentators: 'If he had been the footman of any nobleman,
or lady, merely,' says he, 'the Lord would perhaps have winked
at it, had he cut off his whole head; but the servant of a high priest
was to be respected.'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>We leave the divines for the present, and turn to his next 'mark,'
which is addressed to the learned, whereon he expatiates with a fellow-feeling,
and makes some displays of learning, which will certainly
excite astonishment, if not admiration. His introduction is
as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
'MARK&mdash;LEARNED MAN!'<br />
</p>

<p>'Tis well known, that Lot's wife was changed by God's decree
into a pillar of salt, because, contrary to the divine command, she
looked back; but why she was changed into a pillar of salt, and not
into a thorn-bush, which is as curious and sharp as she was herself,
is because when she entertained the angels who visited her husband,
she put no salt to the meats, that she might be free of these frequent
visitors. Salt has ever been held the symbol of science and wisdom,
as is shown, not only by its being the first syllable in the name of
King Solomon, but inasmuch as Christ says to his disciples, 'Ye are
the salt of the earth.' As meat without salt, so is man without knowledge.
As the poet saith:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A table without a dish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pond without a fish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soup without bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tailor without thread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A horse without a tether,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cobbler without leather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ship without a sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pitcher without ale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a man without wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do well together fit.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'I have, with especial care, examined Holy Writ, and find that
therein the word husbandman occurs thirty-six times; the word field,
three hundred and fourteen times; the word sow, twenty times; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
word grow, five hundred times; the word corn, fifty-seven times;
the word reap, fifty-two times; the word barn, twenty-one times;
the word thresh, fifteen times; the word hay, forty-eight times; but
the word <em>straw</em>, only once,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and that with no great commendation,
where Rachel sat upon it to hide the golden images from her father
Laban. Since, therefore, the word straw occurs but once, I am free
to conclude, that it was holden for something most contemptible.
And as worthless as straw is, so is a man of straw,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
without learning.'</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>'Jesus, our infant Lord, had to lie in a manger at Bethlehem, he
whose abode is the starry heaven; and when his precious body
shivered with cold, and was warmed only by his inward love to us,
he to whom all the hosts of heaven minister, had no attendants, save
an ox and an ass. St. Vincent remarketh, that the ox stood at the
babe's head, and the ass at his feet; whereby he wished to show,
that asses, and such as have no knowledge, should keep in the background,
and those only who have wisdom, stand in the high places.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is more lovely than knowledge? He who hath it, cuts the
'gordian knot' better than the Macedonian monarch, and can answer
all the puzzling questions about which other men busy their brains
in vain. As thus: Why doth a man who hath eaten his fill, till his
body is stuffed like a travelling journeyman's knapsack, weigh less
than before? The philosopher knoweth the reason. Why doth he
who has drank too much wine, commonly fall over forward, while
he who hath drank too much beer, generally falleth over backward?
The philosopher knoweth the reason.'</p>

<p>And again he discusseth learnedly of lawyers:</p>

<p>'In the Old Testament, there was a wondrous drink for women,
which many a one had to swallow, albeit she did not complain of
thirst. For whenever a man conjectured that his spouse was faithless,
he led her to the priest at the altar, who handed her a liquor
mixed with a thousand curses, the which, were she wrongfully
accused, harmed her not; but were she really guilty, lo! she was
incontinently filled therewith, and swelled up like a sack of Bohemian
hops, and pined away; and thus they cunningly learned who
was innocent and who guilty. 'Well,' saith one, 'why happeneth
not the same now-a-days? 'Tis as necessary as in those times, and
men would crowd to buy such a drink, at whatsoever price.' To
this I answer, that such miracles are no longer needful; for the
lawyers, with their <i>citationes</i>, <i>notationes</i>, <i>protestationes</i>, <i>connotationes</i>,
<i>replicationes</i>, <i>contestationes</i>, <i>appellationes</i>, <i>acceptilationes</i>, <i>certiorationes</i>,
<i>confirmationes</i>, and the like, make guilt or innocence as clear as
day.' But mark we how Death treats all this choice Latinity:
'What kind of tongue,' saith Death, 'is this, wherein the Latinists
address me? By my life, I understand not Latin! My father,
the Devil, a substantial man, and my mother, Sin, a notable dame as
any, to save expense, gave me no learning; therefore I care not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>fig for your Latinists. The Almighty has truly taught me somewhat,
but I find my studies differ mainly from yours; for in my grammar,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mors</i> is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">generis communis</i>; in my syntax, the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivo</i> has no
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infinitivum</i>.'</p>

<p>He next addresses soldiers, whom he comforts with the thought
that they need not despair of eternal life, bad as their calling is;
for, saith he:</p>

<p>'St. John, the angel of the apocalypse, tells us, in his description
of the heavenly Jerusalem, how he saw in his trance, that this
metropolis of God was built four-square, and each side garnished
with three doors; whence we can safely conclude, as St. Dionysius
hath it, that from all quarters and parts of the world, there is access
to heaven.</p>

<p>'St. Athanasius wisely observeth of the people of Israel, that when
they entered on a campaign, the ark of the covenant, wherein were
stored the laws of Moses and the ten commandments, was carried
before the host, that the warriors might have God's law continually
before their eyes. Hear this, ye Christian soldiers! The ten commandments
were the avant-guard of the army of Israel; with you,
God help us! they too commonly are sent to the rear.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Who's there?' 'No friend!' 'Who is no friend?' 'I,' says
Death. 'Holla there! Guard, turn out!' 'My loving friends,'
replieth Death, 'I cannot laugh in my sleeve, for I have none; but I
can't help grinning, at finding you think to frighten my scythe with
your pikes and halberts. That would be a joke! How many of the
Jews have I not destroyed? The sum total, as Holy Writ testifieth,
854,002,067! And now shall I be afraid of <em>you</em>? No, no! Order
arms! Albeit your leader, <em>Mars</em>, and I, <em>Mors</em>, are kinsmen in name, I
cannot abide neutral, but declare open war on you! Let him who
doubts my power, go to Vienna, and ask of the first sentinel he
meets!' Inasmuch as Vienna is a rampart of all Germany against
the Turk, it is girt with thick walls, and strong towers. The heavenly
city, Jerusalem, is described by the chronicle as having twelve great
gates; now as Vienna hath six, it may justly be called half a heaven.
It hath always been the wont of the soldiery at Vienna to keep their
main force in the city, and a guard at St. Peter's church-yard; but
this time, Death, against the officers' will, changed their ordering,
and almost all the troops were bidden to <i>lie at ease</i> in the church-yard,
while Death went the rounds, from post to post, on the walls.'</p>

<p>Let us quote the conclusion of this branch of his address:</p>

<p>'Let the body die, then, be it in fire or in water, on earth or in
air&mdash;what matters it! Let it die, this dung-hill, this nest of worms,
this lump of filth, this dying worm, this clod of earth; let it die, this
perishing rottenness, this tricked-out decay, this painted sepulchre,
this congregation of diseases, this bundle of rags, this six feet of
nothing! Let it die!&mdash;let it perish! Let it decay, this living hospital,
this sport of chance, this little heap of earth&mdash;when, how,
where it may&mdash;it matters not! But I beseech thee, by thy soul's
salvation&mdash;I sound it in thine ears, with uplifted hands, let not the
<span class="smcap">SOUL</span> perish! This curious and precious handiwork and image of
God&mdash;this priceless and unfading jewel of eternity&mdash;this pure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
peaceful sister of the spirits made blessed&mdash;oh let not <em>this</em> perish
by sin, for this is the only death that is terrible indeed!'</p>

<p>There are passages like the above, scattered here and there, which
will show that our author was something more than a mere pulpit-joker,
and that he had within him all the elements of high eloquence.
Our conscience, indeed, reproaches us, at times, that we are not
doing the old worthy justice, but picking out his knotty points and
excrescences, to amuse our contemporaries with their odd twists and
turns, and air of hoar antiquity, rather than laying open the sound
core and pith that lie beneath them. But our object&mdash;and we hope
it as an excusable one, in these trying times&mdash;is rather to beguile
the reader into a smile, than edify him by serious discourse, a plenty
whereof is to be found at every corner, without going back for it to
Pater Abraham a Sancta Clara.</p>

<h2><a name="FRANCIS_MITFORD" id="FRANCIS_MITFORD">FRANCIS MITFORD.</a></h2>

<p class="center">NUMBER THREE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> spake of <span class="smcap">Brummell</span>'s opinions of Canada. 'Canada,' said
he, 'is a mere incubus on the already bloated back of England.
The profits derived from the trade of that colony scarcely defray
the enormous expenses of her establishments. Nor is this the worst.
The question of her boundary will one day involve us in a most
bloody and expensive war, demanded, perhaps, by national pride,
but repugnant to our most vital interests; a war, too, with a nation of
brothers, with whom we ought to have but one common view; that
of peaceably extending our laws, language, and commerce, over the
most distant part of the globe. Should there be a war, whether
England emerges from that contest vanquished or triumphant, the
consequences must be equally fatal. Alienation of the present strong
and growing friendship will result, which must tend, more or less, to
restrict the extensive commerce between the two countries, to the
great injury of Great Britain; for though the United States may
easily obtain from other countries the manufactures which she now obtains
from us, at, in the first instance, a triflingly-enhanced price, yet
the grand staple article of cotton cannot be purchased any where so
good, or on such advantageous terms, as in the United States. The
necessity imposed by war on that country of procuring manufactured
commodities elsewhere, would, no doubt, continue in a great measure,
by choice, after peace. The best thing England can do with
Canada, is to present her (with her own consent) to the United States,
or to manumit her from all colonial trammels, and declare her independent.
Thus, by enlisting the pride of the Canadians on the side
of a separate government, she may perhaps succeed in preventing
a junction between this colony and the United States&mdash;if indeed
England can be said to have any real interest in the hindrance of
such a junction. Fifty thousand men sent over to Canada, in case of
war with the United States, at the expense of twenty-five millions,
will not suffice to keep Canada from being overrun by her powerful
neighbours; all military speculations on the subject, to the contrary
notwithstanding.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> is the mortal who has expatriated himself, without feeling
a yearning after home? Home! magical word! bringing with it
vivid recollections of the sweetest scenes of childhood, and those
days of youth, when the mind, freed from care, bounds with joy at
the slightest favorable event! Every man, in considering his home,
looks only to the most pleasing events which occurred during his residence
there, and is apt to consider all the disagreeable circumstances
of his existence as receiving a still darker tinge from his stay
abroad. Mitford was no exception to the general rule. He determined
to return to London, at all hazards.</p>

<p>This resolve was confirmed by another motive. He had long
loved&mdash;ardently loved. The life of dissipation, and even of riot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
which he had led, had not been able to efface the holy passion from
his soul. There it burned, at once a safeguard to, and a promoter of,
other virtues. The fair Marguerite was lovely, rich, and constant in
her attachment to him. Neither the sneers of friends, nor the ill
reports of enemies, were able to efface his image from her mind.
Friendship may be dissolved; fortune may desert us; but woman's
love blossoms in eternal spring, and only blooms the more, amid the
wintry blasts of adversity.</p>

<p>A late correspondence apprized him that her hand and fortune
awaited him. This determined his movements, and he found himself
in London. But the necessary preparatives for a marriage, however
fortunate, require money&mdash;without which the wings of Cupid are
clogged; and though Mitford might have relieved himself by an application
to his lady-love, whose purse was at her own disposal, yet
he could not bear to owe a favor before marriage.</p>

<p>He bethought himself of an expedient. Whenever a man wants
money in London, the surest way to obtain it, is by offering to lend
it, or by offering some great prospective advantage for the sum required.
Many a man parts with what he has, to one whom he thinks
will increase his store when he requires it; but no man parts with his
money to one whom he thinks has none.</p>

<p>A dashing advertisement graced the pages of the 'Post' and
'Herald' newspapers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Extraordinary Facility.</span>&mdash;The advertiser, possessing great influence in a certain
high quarter, would feel disposed to promote the interest of any gentleman of standing
and talent, who has a thousand pounds at his disposal. Address 'A. M.,' Standish's
Rooms, Regent-street.</p>

<p>'N. B. No indiscretion need be apprehended.'</p></blockquote>

<p>We need scarcely say, that our hero answered to the initials of
'A. M.' The applications were numerous. Mitford made a special
appointment with one whom he thought likely to answer his purpose.
He had chambers for the occasion in Lincoln's Inn.</p>

<p>The applicant had recently arrived from the East Indies, and had
some property. The idea of obtaining a respectable post, with a
good salary, at once to increase his income and employ his leisure,
attracted him. Our hero received him in a dimly-lighted apartment.
His back was toward the window. When you are afflicted
with a diffidence, over which you have no control, on important occasions,
always turn the dorsal vertebræ toward the light.</p>

<p>The business was soon opened. The applicant was anxious to
embrace the ideal advantage offered.</p>

<p>'But, my dear Sir,' said Mitford, 'it will be necessary to have some
security in hand, before you are inducted. Without at all doubting
your punctuality, you are aware that in matters of business, particularity
is necessary: beside, I must consult the wishes of my
principal.</p>

<p>The stranger paused! He slowly drew forth his pocket-book,
took out a post bill for £1000, and handed it to Mitford.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> may not a man, by false sophistry, tame his mind to the commission
of a tortuous act! Honesty in man, is like virtue in woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
The possibility of violating it must not for a moment enter the imagination.
In either case, deliberation is destruction.</p>

<p>Mitford, who would not for any consideration have omitted the
payment of a debt of honor; who would have resisted the slightest
imputation on his character unto death; thus reasoned with himself:
'I am on the point of marrying a fortune; why should I hesitate to
appropriate this money, for a few days, when I shall have ample
means to repay it? To be sure, I must endorse the note; but then
the certainty of refunding the amount takes away any moral obliquity
that might otherwise attach to the act.'</p>

<p>Thus soliliquized Mitford; and, endorsing the note, he committed
forgery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">A splendid</span> party had assembled at Sidmouth-Terrace, to celebrate
a bridal festival. Lights beamed far into the park, illuminating
all around. Revelry and joy breathed throughout.</p>

<p>Mitford was there. The sanction of the church was about to seal
the happiness of our hero for ever, when suddenly three officers interrupted
the bridal ceremonies, and seizing Mitford on a warrant
for forgery, conducted him to prison.</p>

<p>To describe the distress of the bride&mdash;the confusion of the
guests&mdash;would be impossible. We leave it to the imagination of
our readers.</p>

<p>The process of the law was rapid. The day of trial arrived.
Mitford pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>All that the most able counsel could effect, was done for him. The
witnesses were brow-beaten; the jury harangued; but he was found
guilty.</p>

<p>The judge passed sentence of death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'<span class="smcap">La!</span>' said Mrs. Minikin, the haberdasher's wife, 'to-morrow is
the day when that there gen'leman is to be hung for forgery. Let's
go see him.'</p>

<p>'My dear,' said Mr. Minikin, 'you know I never likes them there
sort of things. If it was a reg'lar mill, then I might go; but I
never likes to see no one tucked up.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but, my dear,' said the gentle Mrs. Minikin, 'it is not entertaining,
I grant, to see them there riff-raffs which is usually hung;
but this is a gen'leman. Only consider,' said she, in her most endearing
manner, 'how delightful to see one of them there 'igh-flyers
hung!' And the pliant Mr. Minikin consented.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us now turn to the dungeon which contained this ill-fated
man. There, on a scanty supply of straw, a dim light glimmering
through the bars of his cell, rendering the interior still more desolate,
by revealing its wretchedness, lay Mitford&mdash;pale, emaciated,
and bearing on his countenance the conviction, that the world and
himself were now disjointed. Ever and anon the echoing wheels of
some patrician chariot conveyed to his ear the mirth and gayety that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
reigned without. But what was all this to him? His heart was
never more to beat at the sight of beauty; ambition could no longer
convey elevation to his mind. A few short hours, and he must be
brought forth to satisfy the stern severity of the law, and furnish
food to the gaping curiosity of thousands. And was this to be the
termination of his career? Was it for this a mother's holy tears
had blessed his advent to the world?&mdash;that a father's toil had left him
reposing amid the luxuries of wealth? All, all was now shortly to
terminate in the scaffold's terrors, and worse than the scaffold's terrors,
in the scaffold's shame.</p>

<p>While these thoughts passed through his mind, scalding tears
coursed down his cheeks, moistening the straw on which he lay; not
tears extracted by craven fear, but holy drops of penitence.</p>

<p>From this state of mind he was soon awakened by the reverend
clergyman, whose duty it was to prepare him for his approaching
awful change. He whispered to him the hope of divine mercy, so
unquenchable that the most heinous offences failed to suppress it;
that it was true he must suffer a public punishment, at once as an
example, and an earthly atonement for his crime; but the benign
Saviour of mankind had passed through all the ignominy of a public
execution, with a resigned spirit, as an offering for the sins of others;
and in virtue of that offering, he must himself hope for forgiveness,
and suffer with resignation.</p>

<p>The holy man left Mitford more collected in mind, and resolved
to submit to his inevitable fate with piety and courage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning dawned. The fatal bell had struck; the scaffold
had been erected; the gaping multitude, anxious for some horrid
show to awaken their morbid sensibilities, clogged up in thousands
every avenue to the sacrificial altar. Those whom the doom of the
law had fixed that morning to be their last, stood upon the scaffold;
but Mitford was not there; and the great unwashed, who had that
day gone to enjoy the luxury of seeing a gentleman hung, returned
disappointed of half the show.</p>

<p>The mystery must be solved. The betrothed of Mitford had forwarded
a petition to the king, and another to the queen, requesting
a commutation of punishment; but these documents had to pass
through so many avenues of the palace, that they never reached the
royal eye. Receiving no answer, and almost despairing of success,
she flew to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel then filled the responsible situation of the Home
Department. And here let us pause, to do justice to one of the greatest
men of modern times; to one who, at no distant day, is destined to
fill a large space in the world's eye. His father, sprung from the
canaille, by the aid of the spinning-jenny, left his son in possession of
one of the most ample fortunes, even in the wealthiest country in the
world. The father, of rank tory principles, was farther recommended
to royal notice, by the gift of twenty thousand pounds to carry on
a war, which, however unpopular with the nation, a profligate ministry
had induced that nation to believe its honor interested in prosecuting.
The son was thus introduced to royal favor; and it is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
known, that George the Third entertained great personal partiality
for him. He commenced life as a statesman, having, in the outset of
his political career, been inducted into the office of Under Secretary
of State. His whole public life has been a life of office. His experience
is thus greater than that of any man now living. Unfortunately,
having commenced his career as an advocate for tory principles, his
party have always pursued his leaning toward more liberal principles
as a crime, while the more liberal party have always looked with
suspicion on his aid, and viewed him as an enemy in their camp. As
a debater, he is unrivalled; and if many surpass him in those burning
and flowery sentences by which eloquence is distinguished, none
equal him as a ready and always a sensible debater. But in our
times, it unfortunately happens, that if a man commences his life by
advocating bad principles, consistency forces him to adhere to them.
The present world of politics, unlike the divine world to come, admits
of no repentance. Once take your course in evil, you must adhere to
it, if you wish to preserve your reputation. To change for the better,
is certain perdition. Thus because Sir Robert Peel advocated Catholic
emancipation, which he had all his previous life opposed, every
contumelious epithet that rancor could invent, was hurled at him by
his old friends; while the advocates of that measure viewed his accession
to their ranks, not merely with distrust, as but a late convert,
but with jealousy, as tending to rob them of some portion of the
merit of carrying it on the very point of their success. And John
Bull refused, from the hands of Sir Robert Peel and his colleagues, a
greater measure of reform and retrenchment than even the original
advocates held forth. Thus it is, a thief may reform, or become a
useful member of society, if he will only amend; but a politician
must look to nothing but consistency.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fair Marguerite found no difficulty in gaining access to Sir
Robert. Her beauty, her distress, her tale at once simple and affecting,
all conspired to move him. He laid her petition and her woes at
the foot of the throne. Majesty was pleased to find extenuating
circumstances in Mitford's case, and a reprieve was granted to him.</p>

<p>The bitter draught of grief had been too much for the gentle Marguerite.
Her faculties had been too nervously awakened. While her
lover required her aid, reason had kept its throne. His safety insured,
she became a maniac, and the inmate of a mad-house.</p>

<p>Still farther mercy awaited our hero. After some detention in
prison, he was liberated, on condition that he should leave the kingdom,
never to return.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Years</span> had now elapsed. Mitford's error and his shame had alike
been forgotten; and it was supposed he was dead. It was not until
the tempest of a new revolution awoke regenerated France to a
sense of the wrongs endeavored to be inflicted on her by a Bourbon,
whose family a million of foreign bayonets had seated on the throne,
and until Paris taught all the capitals of Europe how easily a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
city could resist a well-appointed army, that a ray of light was shed
upon his fate.</p>

<p>The barriers of the Rue Richelieu had been erected by the people,
and were furiously attacked by squadrons of infantry and cavalry.
The Parisians, led by a most intrepid young man, evidently a foreigner,
defended it to the very utmost. Three charges had been made, and
successfully repulsed. A fourth threatened to carry the barriers.
Some of the pickets were overthrown; and already had a few of the
light cavalry penetrated within. A few stout hearts strove hand to
hand with the military, but numbers had given way. In this emergency,
the gallant leader of the people, waving his tri-colored flag,
sprang in front of the wavering multitude. His gestures, his example,
rëanimated them. Again they pressed forward, and bearing with
them the tide of victory, they successfully repulsed the military; but
their leader had sealed his conquest with his life. He fell, fighting
hand to hand and foot to foot with the leader of the hostile soldiery,
and their bodies lay close together, in the sleep of death.</p>

<p>The strife of the three days past, honorable interment was awarded
the fallen and patriotic brave. Among the latter was not forgotten
the youthful stranger, who had so well defended the barriers of the
Rue Richelieu. The papers on his person proved him to be an
Englishman. That Englishman was <span class="smcap">Francis Mitford</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="MOHEGAN_LANGUAGE_AND_GEOGRAPHICAL_NAMES" id="MOHEGAN_LANGUAGE_AND_GEOGRAPHICAL_NAMES">MOHEGAN LANGUAGE AND GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES.</a></h2>


<p>
<span class="smcap">To the Editors of the Knickerbocker</span>:</p>

<p class="signature"><i>Michilimackinack, August 2, 1837.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> making some inquiries recently of a party of the Mohegan
tribe&mdash;the remnant of whom have made their way to this quarter
within a few years&mdash;I find that they have preserved their traditionary
history for the last two centuries, or more, with a degree of accuracy
which is not common to the native tribes in this region. It is very
well known, from published data, that this ancient tribe occupied
Long-Island and the contiguous main land, on the discovery of the
country, whence in process of time they withdrew eastwardly into
Connecticut, and afterward went west into Massachusetts. They
appear, from the first, to have had the means of instruction, which
have been continued up to the present time, with perhaps less interruption
than among most of the other tribes. This may account in
part for the better preservation of their traditions. Many of them
being able to read, could refer to some things in printed documents.
Others appear to have retained with tenacity that traditionary lore
which the aged among the tribes generally employ the leisure of
their superannuated days in handing down to the young.</p>

<p>During the long residence of this tribe at Stockbridge, (Mass.,) they
were commonly Stockbridges, and after the revolutionary war, when
they transferred their residence to Oneida, in western New-York,
they naturally retained this name, and finally bore it with them to
their present location in Wisconsin territory. I disclaim any intention
to sketch their history; and wish no farther to allude to it, than
appears to be necessary to bring forward a few facts in the character
of their language, and particularly their names for the places of
their former residence, on the lower parts of the Hudson. And as
this is a matter of which but little is generally known, it has appeared
to me of sufficient local interest, to justify the liberty I take in addressing
these remarks to you.</p>

<p>The Mohegan is readily recognised as a type of the Algonquin or
(as Mr. Gallatin has recently denominated it,) the 'Lenapee-Algonkin'
family, and bears a strong resemblance, both in sound and syntax,
to the dialects of some of the existing lake tribes. This affinity is
very striking in its grammatical structure, and its primitive words.
Derivatives, with all our tribes, are subject to interchange their consonants,
or drop them entirely, which creates a necessity of being
constantly on the alert to detect these exchanges. Moreover, the
accent is uniformly moved, or doubled, often creating primary and
secondary accents in the same phrase, which, in an unwritten language,
is alone sufficient to account for numerous mutations. But
what, more than any other principle, affects the <em>sound</em> of Indian
words, in their concrete and derivative states, is the large stock of
(so to say) floating particles, which come into these words in the
shape of prefixes and suffixes. These are, in their offices, almost as
numerous as the purposes of person, tense, number, quality, position,
etc., may require. But while their respective office remains
precisely the same, in almost any given number of dialects in a mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
language, it is found that the several tribes pique themselves in
giving these auxiliary particles a sound peculiar to themselves, by
which something like <em>nationality</em> is kept up. Thus in two dialects
indicating the least change in the primitives or derivatives, to be found
among all the tribes, namely, the Chippewa and Ottowa, these particles,
which, in the animate class for plural, are denoted by <span class="smcap">UG</span>, and
in the local inflections by <span class="smcap">ONG</span>, and <span class="smcap">ING</span>, in the one dialect, are respectively
changed to <span class="smcap">UK</span>, <span class="smcap">ONK</span>, and <span class="smcap">INK</span>, in the other.</p>

<p>Similar to this process, seems to have been the result of change
between the ancient Algonquin and the Mohegan, the latter, like the
Ottowa, constantly substituting <span class="smcap">K</span> for <span class="smcap">G</span>,
and <span class="smcap">P</span> for <span class="smcap">B</span>, etc., but in other
respects, it exhibits numerous gutturals, and some aspirates, which
are but rarely found in the liquid flow of the Algic. It also embraces
the (perhaps) Gothic sound of <span class="smcap">TH</span>, which is wholly unknown (the
Shawnee excepted) to the modern lake dialects.</p>

<p>Geographical terms, with the Indians, are found generally to unite
some natural quality in the features or productions of the country
with an indication of the locality; so that their names are not, as
with us, simple nominatives, but (as in all other cases in these peculiar
languages) the quality, action, etc., transfers itself to the object,
and is expressed in a consolidated phrase. This is one of the most
constant and distinguishing traits of these languages. Their nouns
and adjectives, therefore, as well as their verbs, are transitives.
Even their prepositions take a transitive character, and link themselves,
as with 'hooks of steel,' to the objects to which they are
applied. Thus their name for the island from which this letter is
dated, is Place of the Gigantic Faëries, or, by another interpretation,
Place of the Great Turtle. Detroit is, (literally translated,) Round-ward,
or Rounds-by Place, denoting the sinuosities of the river in
its approach. Sault St. Marie, 'At the Shallow Water with Rocks.'
In another class of derivative words, the union of the substantive
and adjective is without a local inflection, as in their name for Lake
Superior, which is simply called, The Sea Waters; Mississippi, The
Great River; Michigan, The Great Lake, etc.</p>

<p>This principle is found most fully to pervade the Mohegan. I
requested one of the chiefs of the party above referred to, to pronounce
their name for Long-Island. He replied, <span class="smcap">Paum-nuk-kah-huk</span>,
signifying, Place of the Long Land. The name of the coast
opposite to this island, at the mouth of the Hudson, or rather, across
the Sound, he pronounced <span class="smcap">Mon-ah'-ton-uk</span>. Dropping the local
inflection <span class="smcap">UK</span>, meaning place, or land, we have the elements of Manhattan,
the latter of which preserves the original quite as well as the
generality of Indian names transmitted by English enunciation. Philologists
will perceive, farther, that the aspirate <span class="smcap">H</span> would be very
naturally prefixed to the second syllable, while the sound of <span class="smcap">O</span>, being
the sound of <span class="smcap">O</span> in the French word <i>ton</i>, might be expressed, nearly
as well, by some of the modified sounds of <span class="smcap">A</span>.</p>

<p>Judged by similar means of analysis, Sing-Sing is a corruption of
<span class="smcap">Osin-sink</span>, <i>i. e.</i>, Place of Stones, or Rocks; Neversink from <span class="smcap">Nawaisink</span>,
a phrase descriptive of highlands equi-distant between two
waters, as Raritan Bay and the Atlantic. Minisink is, literally, Place
of the Island. Tappan Sea <em>appears</em> to be a derivative from a band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of the Mohegans, who dwelt there, called <span class="smcap">Taponsees</span>, or rather from
the name of their village. After getting through the Highlands,
names of Mohawk derivation occur. Poughkeepsie, Warwarsing,
and Coxsackie, are, however, clearly of Mohegan origin. So far as
I recollect, the ancient name of Albany, <span class="smcap">Ske-nek-ta-da</span>, is the first
term of the Iroquois type of languages, in ascending the Hudson, of
which any notice is preserved. In proceeding east, west, or south-west
from that point, geographical names of this character universally
prevail. But it is to be remarked, that but few sonorous names
occur, until reaching the districts of country formerly possessed by
the Oneidas, Onondagas, and other western branches of this confederacy.</p>

<h2><a name="WILSON_CONWORTH" id="WILSON_CONWORTH">WILSON CONWORTH.</a></h2>

<p class="center">NUMBER SIX.</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Weak</span> and irresolute is man.' I record a fault of human nature,
as well as my own. I resolved and re-resolved, and am the same.
Do I not blush while recording this weakness? Alas! I am dead
to feeling, as it regards my fellows. I have no communion with the
world, now. I pass by, unnoticed and unknown. Still, I have a love
for mankind; and I make these confessions, hoping they may prove
of use to others. I daily see others in the same predicament as myself,
or, if not so far advanced, yet pursuing a course which will
inevitably lead them where I now am. Yes! where I am; and
what is that state? Solitariness, apathy, disgust, fretfulness, heart-ache;
the absence of all the gentle sympathies of life; the death of
all domestic affection; the familiarity of the vulgar and low-bred;
the sneer of the foolish prosperous man; the contempt of the small
thriving gleaner; the neglect of the busy, and the pity of the good.
Oh! yes! one comfort yet remains; the prayers of the pious and
truly religious.</p>

<p>But to my story. As hope began to fade from the heart of my
dear Alice; as she saw I was beyond the influence of her prayers
and entreaties; as she began to be acquainted with the real state of
my habits; as she began to see, that not even my love for her availed
any thing she began to despair. She had involved herself too
deeply to retract. Her feelings had acquired the habit of loving me;
and indeed, though an idle young man, I do not think it strange that
such devotion and tenderness as I sometimes really felt and bestowed
upon her, should have awakened some return.</p>

<p>I was well-bred, had a good person, could sing passably well, by
myself, write good poetry, and was passionate and hot in my evidences
of affection. I was an enthusiast, and women like decided tastes.
They feel an assurance, a confidence in your good, quiet, smooth-faced,
unexcitable, sensible man, if he be young, especially; but they
love life and animation, even though it lead to slight errors. Women
know the difficulty of restraining the feelings within the bounds of
propriety; they are most open to impressions; the real creatures of
feeling, they love feeling in others. They have many struggles with
what they wish, and what they ought to do. They estimate in men
the ardor of the temptation, as an offset to the fault. Hence they
are forgiving.</p>

<p>Women are obliged to keep a constant guard over themselves.
They know their own weakness, and self-protection arms them to
the task. Many a high-souled woman knows this. When you do
find a well-disciplined character in the female form, what a noble one
it is! The labor of the undertaking, the education of self-control,
has made her great. She is a whole host. Look at her influence in
society; see the majesty of her deportment, the easy assurance of
her countenance. How common men quail before her! What
respect and attention she exacts from the titled profligate, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
talented vicious! She is all that is exalted on earth. There is no
beauty to compare with such beauty; no wealth with such charms.
She is the nicest workmanship of God; and in her dwells a soul that
scatters blessings around her. 'The heart of her husband delighteth
in her, and he has no need of spoil.'</p>

<p>Reader, if you are a father, and have seen the son of your hopes,
the inheritor of your name, the bearer of your form and features,
gradually falling a victim to low vices; if you are a mother, and can
trace, in those features now bloated with excess, and in that eye now
dimmed with sensuality, the semblance to the babe that drew its
earliest food from your pure bosom, and remember that eye upturned
to your face as the innocent lay cradled in your arms; if you
are a sister, and mourn the ruin of your bed-fellow; or a brother, and
seen your playmate in prison, you may form some notion of what the
emotions of a fond heart are, when it beholds its stay gone, its prospects
blighted, and its love thrown away upon an unworthy object.
No! not altogether unworthy, but with just enough of good to keep
alive the love, while it mocks all efforts to draw consolation, to answer
the chord in her own bosom.</p>

<p>Love wishes its object to be perfect. None can or must compare
with its choice. How fondly does woman cheat herself, if she can,
into the belief that her choice is fortunate beyond human fortune!
I weep&mdash;even I, who have not wept for years for my own misfortunes&mdash;I
weep, as I recall the memory of the tears she shed over my
irrevocable ruin. She did know my character, at last, and she predicted,
even in spite of her love, all that has happened.</p>

<p>Shall I record that these tears were not a source of pain to me
then? They satisfied my vanity. I always reserved reformation to
myself, and thought she was mistaken; and these scalding tears, as
they coursed down her cheeks, told me that I was beloved. Not even
the misery of the object of my affection could prevent a triumph that
I had over her&mdash;<em>her</em>, the sought-for by many&mdash;that I was preferred
among a multitude. Is this nature? Was I hard-hearted? Would
not any one feel the same? Let the reader examine his own heart,
and answer.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this time, and in this very village, there lived a gentleman, in
the truest sense of the term, by the name of Edward Lang. He
was a man of high family, of aristocratic notions, and thought literature
the chief object worthy of pursuit. At the time I saw him, he
bore the ills of poverty, the burden of a broken heart, and disappointed
hopes. He possessed a well-stored mind, unwearied benevolence,
and a Tremaine-like refinement. He had, in the early part
of his life, encumbered a large fortune with debts of extravagance,
idleness, and folly; and at a subsequent period, lost the remainder
in scheming; for he thought that his prëeminence in literature gave
him prëeminence in every thing.</p>

<p>Every body applauded his plans; they were upon a large scale;
they redounded to the good of the place, and ruined him.</p>

<p>Bred a lawyer, the unfairness of country practice, the low and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
degraded crowd it brought him in contact with, caused him to throw
up his profession. He took to farming; but he only tried experiments,
to the advantage of other people, and his own loss. He got
up all sorts of useful societies, which cost him his time, and paid him
nothing. He bought all the new works for other people to read;
subscribed liberally to reading-rooms and schools. He fatted cattle
for the agricultural society, at six times their worth in corn and care.
Every body in the village improved their own stock by his; but then
all this took money from his pocket.</p>

<p>He did not know the state of his affairs, because he hated settlements.
He could not bring himself down to the drudgery of life,
but did his farming scientifically, in his study, and left the work to
hired hands. He failed, and nobody pitied him. He began to be
called a 'poor good-for-nothing fellow,' whose chimeras had brought
him down. All his neighbors sued him, and he suffered all who
owed him to go undunned. He gave up all for lost; sat himself down
in wretchedness, disgusted with the world, and tired of himself.</p>

<p>I was quite intimate with this gentleman. Being much my senior,
for he was about fifty, and a bachelor, he took it upon himself to
give me a word of advice. He had been in love himself, and that
desperately; though unfortunate in his love affairs, as well as all
others. The father of the lady objected to him, on the score of his
being unfit to make money. He possessed hordes of wealth, himself,
and could have made two hearts happy. But no; this would not do.
His ideas of excellence consisted in the faculty of making money
and keeping it. 'As for literature and refinement, he did not care
for them. <em>He</em> was not a literary man,' he said, 'and yet he was rich,
and respected; a president of a bank; had been an unsuccessful candidate
for congress, which was <em>some</em> honor, and had it in his power
to fill any office in the town he would accept. No; he preferred a
man of business for a son-in-law.'</p>

<p>He found one; a coarse, rough, unlettered country-merchant,
whose ideas were bounded by the length and breadth of his counter;
whose whole soul was given to traffic. A sloven, except on Sundays
and courting-days, and then only clean on the outside. This fair,
delicate, daughter of wealth, possessed of a mind and education much
beyond her family's comprehension, was wedded to this '<em>respectable</em>'
man. Her heart was broken by this savage act of parental
authority. She died during the first year of her wedlock, and Edward
Lang was for two years deranged, and woke from this sleep of reason,
to find himself without hope, without motive, without sympathy.</p>

<p>He took to his books; he shut out the world, and dwelt upon the
beautiful and good in theory; lived in a love for the generous, the
exalted, and happy scenes of his imagination. When forced abroad
by his friends, he seemed lost and unhappy; he was disturbed from
this resting which an unfortunate mind derives from picturing for
others what he knows can never be for him.</p>

<p>By the world at large he was said to nourish false views of things,
because he had a higher standard than the world generally live by.
By these means he unfitted himself for society, and was voted dull,
eccentric, and love-sick. Time, however, softened his regrets, and
he came out in the scheming life I have referred to, in which, by acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
by principle and science, even in the work of agriculture, he lost
his all.</p>

<p>When I was introduced to him, he was living with an old aunt,
upon his paternal estate. Though poor, they had about them those
marks of refinement, which well-educated people will contrive to
weave out of common materials. Whether on the farm, in the garden,
at his table, in church, or in the street, no one could see Mr.
Lang, and not say with certainty that he was a gentleman. The
aunt belonged to the old school of ladies, rather prim and stiff; and
yet her benevolent face, her self-possession, and quiet dignity, gave
her great influence in society. Her reading and good sense, her
piety and patience, were proverbial. Every body called her 'madam,'
and treated her with marked respect. I was on the most familiar
terms at their house; for I believe they felt that I appreciated them.
It was the sympathy of people educated in the same way.</p>

<p>This gentleman was of great service to me. From the examination
of his own feelings, he had learned much of the nature of passion;
from severe suffering, he had become acquainted with misfortune.
I used to confide to him all my sorrows, and I told him my
struggles. He saw my remorse, and pitied my irresolution.</p>

<p>Alice, too, had confidence in him. They often rode together; and
his age and purity of life, and the nice delicacy of his feelings,
induced her to open her heart to him. He felt flattered, as well he
might, by the trust this noble girl reposed in him. But, beside, he
had read so much of love, thought so much of it, and suffered so
much for it, that he engaged in the contemplation of our affairs with
the <i>goût</i> of an epicure over a favorite dish. He lived over again
hours of past endearment of his own. He felt young and ardent,
as he listened to the recital of conversations and difficulties which I,
with the greenness of a boy, always told him.</p>

<p>Things had arrived at a pass dangerous for both of us; and as yet
her parents knew nothing. One of our conversations happened to
be heard by the lady's mamma, and papa was informed of all. He
was surprised, but affected to treat the matter quite coldly; told me
I was too young, too unsettled, to think of matrimony, and very
politely forbade me his house; 'as,' he said, 'the sooner we forgot
each other the better.'</p>

<p>I ought to confess, here, that my habits had got to be quite irregular.
I attended horse-races, tavern-suppers, balls, and sometimes
drinking-parties, when the society was by no means the most select;
and to drown the mortification, and get to the level of my companions,
I ran into excesses that shattered my nerves, and made me unfit, for
days, for any calm reflection.</p>

<p>I have always felt the consequences of this mode of life. Even
the best minds will become tainted by contact with vulgarity and
coarseness. The purest taste will get degraded, in a measure, by
constant intercourse with low persons, such as young men who have
nothing to do usually meet about taverns, stage-houses, and strolling
theatres. We even acquire habits of speaking and pronunciation,
and of cant terms, which are beneath a gentleman.</p>

<p>When low-bred men engage in pleasure, 'plenty of stuff to drink'
is deemed the first essential. We are getting rid, to be sure, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
character of 'a nation of drunkards;' but when I was a boy, liquors
were set out upon all occasions; at weddings, at funerals, dinners,
calls, paying money, or dunning-visits. People in the country, of
respectability, used to drink at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and
at four in the afternoon. That was genteel. The class who drank
before breakfast then, now drink only at eleven; and those who
drank only at eleven, drink not at all.</p>

<p>It was the custom, too, to drink before meals for an appetite; for
appetite was considered a mark of health, however produced.
Among very good sort of people, this was a common notion, that a
man could work in proportion to the food he took into his stomach;
so workmen were swilled with drams for an appetite.</p>

<p>It is certainly true, that temperance societies cannot hope for any
permanent results in their exertions, unless there is a corresponding
movement in other societies. Education societies, peace societies,
temperance societies, and religious societies, they all have a common
object and common cause, to ameliorate the state of man. They
point to a common centre. People will not become temperate, and
remain irreligious, and quarrelsome, and ignorant. I have often
thought it would be well to turn all our efforts to educating mankind;
and I believe all other objects would be protected by the course of
events. But it is very questionable whether any benefit can result
from taking down names to pledges not to drink spirits, in places
where schools are not supported, nor the house of God attended.</p>

<p>In this village, every body drank at times, at parties and balls;
and to be a little boosy, was by no means disreputable. Judges,
members of congress, lawyers, doctors, mingled in these frolics, for
popularity's sake; and the people at large thought, of course, they
might go, upon the strength of such examples, to any extent.</p>

<p>If I had, by retirement, escaped the contamination of what are
called 'glossed vices' in the city, in the country I contracted habits
of a grosser nature. I do not mean to be understood as being a
drunkard; but I had frequent 'scrapes;' my selection of associates
was less nice; my delicacy less; my sense of honor less accurately
defined. I lost, in refinement of feeling, immeasurably.</p>

<p>Taking all these things into view, it is no wonder that my intended
father-in-law looked upon me with suspicious eyes. He was a man
who had seen the ruin of many a likely young farmer and mechanic,
from the same beginnings; and he was by no means pleased with
my prospects. So I was forbidden to think of his daughter. She
was sent out of town, I could not tell where, and I immediately left
the village of N&mdash;&mdash; for a wider sphere of dissipation.</p>

<p>I returned to the city, coarse in my manners, rough in my appearance&mdash;thanks
to the country tailor!&mdash;with large whiskers, and a
swaggering bar-room air. I found, upon comparing myself with city
appearances, that I was at least ten years behind the age. I blushed,
looked ashamed, and avoided former acquaintances, who would greet
me with, 'Well, Conworth, where the devil have you been?' or,
'Where the devil did you get those whiskers?' Mind, reader, I
had been sentimental for a year, and when I was with gentlemen,
was as stiff as country gentlemen usually are. Think, then, how my
feelings must have been shocked at such familiarity, when I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
looking as grave as an owl, dressed up in my long-tailed coat, large
pantaloons, nicely polished thick boots, and long-napped, broad-brimmed
hat, with whiskers covering the sides of my face, and my
complexion the color of a coal-heaver.</p>

<p>Tailors and time work wonders; and in a short time my country
friends would hardly have known me. I soon settled down into
courses of dissolute life. I had no restraints. I imagined myself a
martyr to love, and was, indeed, unhappy; persuaded myself that I
had no hope, and particularly when about half drunk, I sighed like
a furnace.</p>

<p>I spent one year, one precious year, of my youth in this manner.
I was desperate; lived away from home, and only visited my friends
when I was in want of money.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when my stomach was deranged, and my brain flighty,
I meditated self-destruction. I was only at ease when rioting in
excitement. I kept all sorts of company, and indulged in all sorts
of vices. I cannot imagine a more dissolute young man than I was
in conduct, who keeps himself this side of penal crime; though it is
worthy of remark, that I never recollect having indulged in any vice,
unless under artificial stimulus.</p>

<p>I believe my father thought himself a little in the wrong, by suffering
such desertion as I met with from all my friends. He pitied
me, and in the most affectionate manner persuaded me to return to
his house. A word of kindness was to me like manna in the wilderness.
I eagerly acceded to his proposal. He paid me every attention,
and actually left his business, and travelled with me for two
months, and endeavoured to bring my mind back to pleasant reflections;
for I was indeed almost a maniac. This was the balm in
Gilead to my sick mind. I came to myself, and with my father's
permission I went to spend the remainder of my clerkship at the
celebrated law-school at L&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I have always had the strongest inducements to do well. After
all my errors, before I left home, the friends of our family vied in
showing me kindness. I was in a constant round of the most refined
society. To be sure, I had the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> of having been disappointed in
love with the finest girl in the country; and any thing about love is
interesting; and to be crazy or drunk for love, is not so bad as to be
so for any other cause.</p>

<p>I was grateful for these favors and attentions; and when I left
home for the law lectures, I really believe all my friends were firmly
persuaded that I was an instance of wonderful reformation. So
credulous and forgiving are our friends for the sake of what they
know we can and ought to be!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I wish</span> my reader could sympathize with me, upon coming thus far
in my history. I am aware that I have written nothing of much importance,
so far as incident may be looked for. But, to my view, life
is rather a succession of feelings and sentiments, than of actions.
It fills me with inexpressible satisfaction, to find that I have mastered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
my adversaries, idleness and irresolution, in this instance, and have
come to this point. It is the longest and most arduous task I have
ever performed, for it is a work of continued exertion. I have
never flagged from it; and the idea that some good inferences may be
drawn from these pages, by the young among my own countrymen,
so that my life may not pass away without one useful act, one deed
of positive good, has supported me.</p>

<p>Let every idler, if he wishes to enjoy one happy hour, set about doing
something, no matter what. Let him undertake to commit a chapter
in the Bible to memory, or copy some piece of writing, or to make any
intellectual exertion; but let it be definite; not take a walk, or a journey,
or any thing that requires movement of the body, but still, continued,
uninterrupted study and attention. Idlers are the veriest busy-bodies
we know, and always flying about in some shape or other.
They are idle with the appearance of industry, and deceive every body
but themselves. While the world looks on, and wonders at their diligence,
they are passing hours, days, years, of the most insupportable
care, the care of finding something to do. I know something of the
tedium of this life, and confess, that the hours spent in these records
have been the happiest of my life, because I have had an end, an
object, constantly in view.</p>

<p>My debts all paid once more, my character again rëinstated,
my purse well supplied, my wardrobe in the newest fashion, and
abundant as I could pack, behold the rustic of a year's standing,
the lover, whose heart was broken, getting into the stage for L&mdash;&mdash;,
the place of the celebrated law-school; while Thomas, dressed in
the self-same suit in which I had arrived some year before, is packing
the trunks on behind. Alas! the association of that event and
those pantaloons! Reader, they did put me in mind of the romantic
hills and valley of N&mdash;&mdash;, and then of Alice Clair; though to
get to these affecting thoughts, I had to pass through the tailor's shop
where they were made. There is but a step from the sublime to the
ridiculous, and so backward from the ridiculous to the sublime.</p>

<p>But in the height of my satisfaction in being permitted to take a
new start in the world, under such favorable auspices, my love-disappointment
did not weigh very heavily upon my heart. I had
already, as I thought, performed all my promises of being a good
student, etc., for I wished to, and I took the will for the deed. I
wished it so much, that not a doubt or misgiving disturbed the serenity
of my mind. I esteemed it a settled matter, that I was, in the
first place, to make myself remarkable as a student; and then, without
any trouble, to walk directly to the top of the profession. I was
a sanguine&mdash;&mdash;fool!</p>

<p>This confidence inspired my father with golden hopes; and when
we parted, he told me he was the happiest man in the city. 'Now,
my son,' said he, 'you are old enough (I was twenty) to begin to
form a character; all your wild oats are sown; the past is forgotten;
you have your destiny in your own hands. Write to me often; tell
me all your wishes; and (here the devil jogged his elbow) draw upon
me, if you want more money. God bless you, my dear boy!' The
tears started in his eyes; mine were wet, too. As I got into the stage,
(mark the baseness of my heart!) I dwelt mostly upon the words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
'Draw upon me, if you want more money.' My eyes ceased their
weeping. I addressed some gay make-acquaintance remarks to a
fellow passenger, and as we rattled over the bridge in the velocipede
line of coaches, forgot every thing but the beauty of the morning,
and only wondered how long it would be before breakfast.</p>

<p>So contemptible is the <em>spirit</em> of youth, in its blind passion for pleasure.
All the higher, nobler feelings sink into insignificance, compared
with its own selfish enjoyments. Pleasure, love of pleasure,
tramples upon the holy influences of home; it steels the heart to
filial affection; it saps the juices of youth; and leaves the young
body prematurely cold, and lifeless, and insensible, to the natural
action of all those relations and sentiments, that reason is intended
to draw its moral food from. The mother 'who watched o'er our
childhood' is forgotten; the father disregarded, and the sister's face
is crimsoned with shame for us, and we ourselves are lost. And for
what? For an hour's amusement; a short-lived enjoyment; an empty
sound of revelry, and unmeaning mirth.</p>

<p>What inconsistency! Hardly had I got a step from my father's door;
hardly had my fingers lost the affectionate pressure of his hand,
when the evil genius stepped in, to scatter the impressions which a
moment before seemed so fixed.</p>

<p>Since the time of my mother's death, I never had passed the door
of the chamber where she died, without thinking of the evening
when I visited her corpse, alone&mdash;a pure boy, free from all vice, all
contamination&mdash;and then drawing the comparison between the present
and the past. Such reflections always gave me pain, and summoned
up all the resolution I was master of. I am convinced, that,
if I had had a mother until my mind had acquired strength and
firmness, I should have been a better and a happier man.</p>

<p>A father's love acts upon us later in life, but a mother leads us up
to God. She bends and moulds our tender minds to her purposes so
gently, that we are hardly aware of the pressure; but the father
admires, and praises, and waters the more vigorous branches of our
growth.</p>

<p>Our reading, our studies, sermons, nature, observation, tend to
give to the mother a poetical interest in our hearts, in after years,
when she is dead. She is the nucleus about which gather some of
the most beautiful associations of our manhood. When we ourselves
have children, we find out what is the nature of parental affection,
and we look back with regret that we did not know and estimate it
better, so that the homage of our love might have been more devoted,
for what is so worthy of being repaid.</p>

<h2><a name="EYES_AND_LIPS" id="EYES_AND_LIPS">EYES AND LIPS.</a></h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE COMMON-PLACE BOOK OF A WESTERN BACHELOR.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">An</span> ingenious friend, who has a saturnine cast of complexion,
maintains with great zeal, that dark eyes are indicative of a higher
order of intellect than those of other colors. This doctrine meets
with great favor from every one whose eyes are black, while those
that are blue, hazel, or gray, kindle with indignation at such monstrous
absurdity. Our friend borrows a very happy illustration from
nature, and says, that as the wildest and most vivid flashes of lightning
burst from the blackest clouds, so do the most brilliant emanations
of mind glare from the darkest eyes. Whether there be any
truth in this doctrine, or not, it must be admitted, that our friend has
the authority of the poets on his side. From immemorial time, they
have been sonnetizing dark and black eyes, to the almost utter neglect
of all others. Your novelists never in painting a heroine, say
she has gray eyes; but all their poetical fictions see with those that
are large, languishing, lustrous, and dark.</p>

<p>The vividness of an eye's expression is not dependent on its color.
The eye is most expressive, whose owner has the most thought and
feeling. The eye expresses the language of the mind and heart;
and whether light or dark, wherever there is strong emotion, it manifests
it. A man is a better reader of the meaning of a woman's
eye, than he is of one of his own gender; and a lady discovers more
indications in the eyes of the opposite sex, than can the most scrutinizing
man.</p>

<p>The eye is the most poetical of features; and ample testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
has been borne, in all time, to its superiority in this particular. There
is much poetry in the smile of one we love; but there is more in the
gleaming kindness of an eye from which the concentrated rays of
feeling, thought, and sentiment, are looking forth. Did you never
look into the tranquil depths of an eye, and see the shadows of
thoughts winging their flight onward? Did you never read whole
chapters about the sympathy of souls in them? If not, your observation
has not been acute, nor your love very devout.</p>

<p>The sublime science of astrology, which once commanded the
faith of the learned, has been laughed at by the wisdom or scepticism
of more modern times. The doctrines and the devotion of
those old readers of the stars have been discarded; and to the human
eye the only relict of astrology now on earth has been confided.
Lovers are the sole inheritors of the romantic doctrines bequeathed
by elder astrologers to posterity. They do not cast devout looks
toward the bespangled firmament, at night; but to them, the brow of
a beloved being is a heaven, and the eye is the star that unfolds to
them the shadows of their coming destinies. Their ancestors read
the decrees of fate in the glittering watchers of the night-season, and
they foresee the mysteries of the future in the expressions which shift
and play upon the eye. If the eye of his mistress sparkles at his
approach, it is the precursor of after joy. If the murky shadow
of a frown rests upon it, it is the foreshadowing of the woe to come.
To the lover, the eye of his mistress is ever eloquent, of hope or fear,
of triumph or defeat. It is the polar star of his hope, the cynosure
of his faith; and the complexion of the future changes, as her eye
wanes into shadow, or waxes into the light of day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A wholesome</span> lip is a thing to be loved. People are too much in
the habit of regarding lips as mere appendages to the 'human face
divine'&mdash;ornaments, like ear-rings, to set off its beauty. This is to
detract from their true use and excellence. They serve other purposes,
and are indices of character.</p>

<p>A wholesome lip is of the complexion of a morello cherry. It
pouts like a rosebud, and might lead a bee astray, as the grapes of
Zeuxis did the birds. When kissing was in fashion, gallants of taste
showed a flattering preference for lips of this kind. There was a
flavor about them&mdash;ambrosia, on which young Love fed and grew
fat. The disciple of Socrates was feminine in the matter of lips,
for bees hovered over them; and the judgment of a bee, in this
respect, is scarcely inferior to that of a bachelor under thirty.</p>

<p>In general, people are disposed to think their noses of more importance
than their lips, and many saucy noses seem to be of the
same way of thinking; since we see them turning up with an expression
of high disdain, as if the lips were so inferior as to merit scorn.
No 'genteel,' well-behaved nose, is guilty of such dastardly effrontery.
Such an one, it is true, may at times flap its nostrils, and crow
lustily over its neighbors, as if it were 'cock of the walk;' but there
is a soft insinuation about an eloquent lip, that cuts the comb of the
braggart, and tames the monarch down to a mere republican.</p>

<p>Our maiden aunt Sally wore a lip, which, like her matrimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
chances, was rather shrivelled. It was a mere streak along the horizon;
an indistinct margin along an ocean of mouth; a strip to tell you
where her teeth were. My aunt died husbandless. If she had wedded,
her bridal kiss would have been interesting. She saluted my
cheek once, when, like Fanny, I was 'younger than I am now,
and prettier&mdash;of course!' I thought the sensation like a gentle
bite. Instead of soft, spongy flesh, her lips seemed like scraps of
flesh, iron-bound. Sometimes she puckered them up like the orifice
of her reticule; and this was an infallible precursor of a coming
storm. Xantippe had a thin, bluish, unwaving lip. Beware of
such!</p>

<p>My nurse was a grizzly-headed negro woman; and her gift of
underlip was stupendous. It poured down, a real cataract of lip.
It was without model, although not without shadow. She was deficient
in chin, and her lip circled over her lower jaw-bone, in shape
and size resembling a half-grown grey-hound's ear. At a distance, you
might have mistaken it for an extra allowance of tongue, which her
mouth could not contain. It was awful! That is, to think of kissing
such a thing! When the old woman bustled about, it shivered
like a sheep in shearing-time; and when she jumped, it flapped over
her under-jaw like the wing of a squat pigeon.</p>

<p>Among the ladies, there are two orders of lips&mdash;the nectarine and
the vinegarish. The former swell out like the heave of a deep sigh;
the latter are sharp, and make you smack your mouth when you look
on them. The first denotes amiability, the second acidity. Everlasting
spring lives in the blossoms of a nectarine lip, and eternal
winter dwells upon the vinegarish, along which no rill of blood ever
strays.</p>

<p>The lips of one's sweet-heart are a volume of poetry. Smiles fling
a ray like the flush of morning upon them, and they are glorious in
their brightness. They are an oracle, and from them comes the
voice of destiny. They are a shrine, and around them the breath of
inspiration ever lingers. It would be vain to talk of kissing any
thing so sacred, when the mere thought overwhelms one in unspeakable
bliss!</p>

<span class="smcap">Shakspeare.</span><br />
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my morning walk in the country, the other day, a common poor-house
hearse passed me. It was a long box, painted black, covered
with a scant piece of dark cloth of some kind, hardly large enough to
allow the tassels to dangle down its sides, in imitation of more gorgeous
drapery. The little door at the hind-end of it looked as if it might
open into the infernal regions. This dismal box, mounted nakedly
on four frail wheels, was drawn along by a pale, lean horse, and the
driver sat severe in his shirt-sleeves and tattered hat, like some desperate
blackguard driving a night-cart. As he passed the cottages on
the road-side, I observed anxious faces following its course; and
particularly that of one poor woman, with an infant in her arms,
whose poverty-stricken cheek was blanched still whiter, for the moment,
as she contemplated the probable picture of her own humble
obsequies. I imagined her as thinking of the time when she should
leave her unprotected little ones to the chance charities of a heartless
world&mdash;heartless to her&mdash;and herself be carried in this same
vehicle to a stoneless grave.</p>

<p>I felt indignant at this unnecessary harrowing up of her feelings,
and my own were not pleasantly affected; and then, and since, I have
thought much upon the subject of funerals.</p>

<p>What moral purpose is answered in thus thrusting the thought of
their dissolution upon the poor and miserable, amid their labors and
wants? Is not life hard enough for them to bear, burthened with
hunger and no food, with ignorant vice&mdash;habitual and early inculcated
vice&mdash;which, in their view, is almost virtue, and certainly, is
second nature? Must they turn horror-struck from the neglect, even
to the remains of the poor beings who, like themselves, are not freed
by death from the selfish contempt of their fellows? Why must the
bell send forth those tones that seem to the sick and weak nerves of
the feeble like a summons from the grave? Why this sickening array
in musty black, this dressing up a banquet for the worm, with terrific
ceremonies? Death is less awful to all, on account of the departure
from life, than because of the black badges, the dark and gloomy
retinue, that are associated in our minds with the event of it. When
we think of dying, it is of being put in a coffin, the white shroud setting
off, in loathsome contrast, the yellow palor of the face, and
the indescribable expression of the human features without a soul;
and then comes the black carriage, and that decaying pall, which
has served so many like occasions, and which will itself, though with
the sexton it looks as if it had a terrestrial immortality, finally perish,
and be cast aside to rot, but with no ostentatious funeral. The
motion, too, of this procession is slow; and our torture is felt as lingering
and fated. At last, we rest in the dark earth&mdash;we are lonely
and out of hearing&mdash;pinioned for ever! It would seem that human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ingenuity had contrived a tissue of horrors to close the troubles of a
human life.</p>

<p>Death is serious business, to be sure, and our passage through its
shadows is a fearful journey. Yet it is an entrance to immortality.
The entrance to magnificent temples, and brilliant theatres, is through
dark portals&mdash;necessarily dark to be firm; and nothing human can
add to the solemnity of death; but we may, by our sympathetic attempts
at the terrible-sublime, change what is solemn and salutary
into a source of disgust and aversion.</p>

<p>We come into a world of care, and want, and affliction, and our
unconscious ears are struck with sounds of rejoicing. We enter
upon an immortality of bliss, and around the self-same body there
are wailing and lamentation.</p>

<p>I was perplexing myself for a solution of this strange inconsistency
in our customs, when chancing to meet a philosophic friend, he relieved
my perplexity, by saying: 'Oh, people are afraid of going to
hell, and that their friends are gone there, and so they make all this
sad array. They usher their relations into eternity&mdash;for the soul in
our associations ever accompanies the body&mdash;as criminals are led
to execution. Their awful fate thus finds an awful language.'</p>

<p>If these be the true reasons of the gloomy ceremonies of death, it
is devoutly to be hoped that the fears of this result may in some cases
be unfounded. We do not wish to controvert the idea of rewards
and punishments hereafter, for they belong to the nature of the soul,
whether in this world or in the next; but it seems rather extra-judicial,
a plain case of supererogation, to bestow upon <em>all</em> the marks of
divine justice before hand.</p>

<p>In case of executions in human justice, if they take place <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in terrorem</i>,
to awe the multitude into obedience, it is very well to dress the
hangman in the probable habiliments of the devil, and to ride the
culprit through the streets as a show, upon a pine coffin. There
should be as little romance, as few flowers in his way, as possible.
It is gross inconsistency, certainly, to introduce any softening circumstances
into public executions, as well as mistaken mercy to the
passions of men. In saying this, we suppose it is not pretended that
the execution of human beings is authorized upon any other ground
than support of the law. To execute privately, or with as little terror
as possible, is to enact over again the trick of Nero to ensnare his
subjects: for surely, the penalty is part of the law, and the execution
of it should be as open as the condemnation, or the people are robbed
of these horrid privileges of assisting their virtue.</p>

<p>But to return to our subject. We dislike our funerals, because
they seem to be one of the remains of the many attempts to subject
the people to the control of the priests. And now, we blush to write
it, we fear the influence of the clergy in some churches is mainly
dependent upon a certain idea people have, that their future destiny
is somewhat in such hands. It is a poor compliment to our religious
nature, to suppose we are most fit to give our hearts to God, when
under an abject fear of death; that</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When thoughts of the last bitter hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come like a blight over our spirits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make us to shudder, and grow sick at heart,'<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>we are best prepared to pay that voluntary homage, to feel that free
devotion, which can alone be pleasing to our Creator.</p>

<p>Funeral occasions have been hailed as special seasons for operating
upon the nervousness of people. Every poor body is dragged
about, and exposed to the public gaze, in the church or meetinghouse,
upon the same principle that a recruiting sergeant drums his
gaily-attired soldiers about a town. Public men, the property of the
people, should be buried publicly, for all are supposed to sympathize
in the loss; all feel a personal interest in the ceremony. But it is
otherwise with private individuals. Then it is death we see, and
not a departed friend. But a still stronger objection lies against this
display of corpses, and these <em>very</em> public burials, and it is, that the
poor are encouraged to indulge in mourning apparel, which they
often can ill afford. The salutary terror upon the wicked is more
than counteracted by the want and criminal shifts induced by this
unnecessary extravagance.</p>

<p>Talk with any man who is not a slave to custom, upon the subject
of burning the dead, and he will, with few exceptions, express a liking
of it for his own body. If we retain the portraits of our friends as
sacred treasures, nay, if a lock of hair, even, be held as a precious
memento, why not retain their very ashes embalmed in fire? Who
that has beheld the play of Virginius&mdash;we are glad to connect a fine
feeling with the stage&mdash;and seen the urn of Virginia, has not felt a
thrill of pleasure that so much is left to the fond father to hug to his
bosom? (How Cooper played Virginius!) Who has not felt a wish,
then, to have the ashes of some departed friend, to embrace in like
manner in his arms? Suppose a father, a brother, a husband, a lover,
to return, after long absence; death has cut down his darling child,
his saint-like sister, his wife; perhaps, what is hardest to bear, because
never thought of as possible, his only love; perhaps pestilence
has swept away all of these. He is pointed to their graves, or to the
common tomb of his kindred. A slight mound of earth is all that is left
him to associate with the loved object; or what is worse, he goes to
the tomb, and there is no charm in his sorrow to heal itself, for it has
lost all individuality: he looks upon an array of coffins, and they all
look alike; he cannot separate his own sacred sorrow from the intrusive
presence of that of others. But place in his hands the ashes of
those he loved; let him be alone with the embalmed dead. He will
kiss the cold urn; imagination will place the cold corse in his arms,
and he will take his last embrace, and serenity will begin to dawn
upon his mind. As he replaces the urn in its sacred deposit, he will
feel, 'She is not dead, but sleepeth!'</p>

<p>The headless trunk of the great Pompey was not left to decay
upon the sea-shore. How it rejoices us to learn, after following his
fortunes to his unhappy death, when he is cast upon the sand, neglected
and uncoffined, that his faithful slave gathered a small pile of
wood, and burned his body, carefully collecting the ashes. As soon
as the task is done, Pompey is great again; and we close his history
with satisfaction, for he is buried with affection. Far better is such
a fate, than the freezing ceremony of a modern funeral.</p>

<h2><a name="EDITING_AND_OTHER_MATTERS" id="EDITING_AND_OTHER_MATTERS">EDITING AND OTHER MATTERS.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A CHAPTER FROM AN UNPUBLISHED VOLUME.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The 'Literary Gazette'</span> created a great sensation. Frank was
congratulated by his friends on the excellence of his hebdomadal.
His editorial brethren bestowed liberal commendation; and he was
bespattered with praise, where he expected to be flattered by criticism.
To be sure, there were some croakers, who thought it a little
too light, and some blithe hearts thought it a little too heavy; but
generally, great satisfaction was expressed with its contents. Subscribers
flocked in, and every thing went on swimmingly.</p>

<p>But however lightly Frank's bark danced at first, he soon found
that there were clouds, storms, and rough waters, to be encountered,
as well as sunshine and soft winds. An author whom he reviewed
with deserved severity, was sure to regard what was said as an
emanation of jealousy. Rejected fi'penny rhymists reported him
unfriendly to the 'infantile efforts of genius.' Bilious moralists condemned
him for what their evil-seeking imaginations tortured into
profligacy. In this way, his judgment and goodness of heart were
underrated; and although he won more smiles than frowns, yet he
sighed when he thought of the goodness of his motives, and the
abominable constructions which were frequently put upon them.</p>

<p>In addition to these grievances, the drudgery of preparing matter
for his paper soon became sickening. At times, heavy demands
were made on his exhausted brain; and then the ungentle efforts to
lash his mind into a fury; to spread the wings of an imagination
borne down by lassitude; to wake up reluctant thought; were most
unpleasant. And yet he knew it must be done, and that his readers
would judge him by his weakness rather than his strength. This
knowledge, with his desire to please, placed him often in a dilemma
which nothing but kindred experience can appreciate. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
was in the mood, composition was an agreeable occupation; but
when draft after draft had been made upon his labors, a sense of
fatigue would come over him, and he knew that the stream of thought
yet in motion under such cloudy auspices, would reflect but little
brilliancy on the vision of his readers. The misery of editorship is,
that one dull article will receive more reprobation than a score of
successful ones can remove. Men are prone to judge of things by
the worst lights. The virtue which one practices, will seldom be considered
expiatory of his vices; the day is judged of by the minute
of cloud, rather than the hour of sunshine; and a line of dulness
will condemn a page of vivacity. We look at the specks on the sun,
the mole on the cheek of beauty, and the blemish on the statue otherwise
perfect in its symmetry.</p>

<p>Often, while revelling in visions of happiness, Frank would be recalled
to his earthly duties, by the entrance of the boy from the printing-office,
y'clept, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, the devil. Every editor is aware of
the felicity which these intrusions into his sanctum afford. Fixed in
his arm-chair, with a horizontal line of leg before him, while his fancy
is with his sweet-heart, or his wife and little ones, as the case may be,
he feels quite comfortable. At the next instant, all his glistening
thoughts and fairy fancies are 'knocked into <i>pi</i>,' by the entrance of
the imp of the printing-office, with a face streaked with ink, round-aboutless
and vestless, and having on a pair of inexpressibles hitched
up on one side by a twine string, who shrieks out, in a merciless
tone, 'I'm come for copy, Sir!' Cowper said that the bray of an
ass was the only unmusical sound in nature; but the poet had never
experienced the discord occasioned to an editor's mind, by an inopportune
demand for 'copy,' or he would have make one more exception.</p>

<p>Often did Frank hold with the dirty-faced urchin such a dialogue
as the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Devil.</i> 'They want more copy, Sir.'</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> 'What's become of that I sent before?'</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> 'It's used up, Sir.'</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> 'Isn't it enough?'</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> 'Not by a jug-full, Sir.'</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> 'How much more is wanting?'</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> 'Three columns, Sir.'</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> 'When will it be wanted?'</p>

<p><i>Devil.</i> 'Why, I've been here twice before this morning, and I
couldn't get in. The foreman's mad as h&mdash;ll, and says how as that
the paper can't be got out in time.'</p>

<p><i>Frank.</i> 'Well, be off. I'll have some copy ready in an hour.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Devil goes off, with a sunken aspect, muttering, as he goes, 'I
gets more kicks than coppers. The foreman kicks me for not getting
copy, and the editor kicks me for coming for it. Deuce take
'em both! As to the paper, she may be late, for me; and as to the
press, I wish she was blow'd to the mischief!'</p>

<p>The 'devil' talks upon the common principle, when he speaks of
the paper and the printing-press as belonging to the feminine gender.
Your statesman, speaking of the country's prosperity, says,
'<em>Her</em> commerce, <em>her</em> manufactures, and <em>her</em> arts, are flourishing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
will soon advance <em>her</em> high in the respect of nations.' The backwoods-men
say of Cincinnati, '<em>She</em> is the western <em>queen</em>.' A Kentuckian
will pet his rifle, and say, '<em>She's</em> leetle the slickest bore in these parts,
and her voice is sweet as Nannie's, and that's saying a heap for <em>her</em>.'
Some go so far as to sex learned bodies, and to say of congress, 'The
constitution does not confer such powers on her, and beyond those
delegated she cannot rightfully act;' thus flinging a petticoat over
this venerable body of gray-haired bachelors, husbands, and orators.</p>

<p>The fact is, it is quite difficult to understand the reason why the
neuter gender is not applied to all things neither male nor female.
Every vessel that skims the billow, in common nomenclature, belongs
to the feminine gender. There is not a steam-boat that ploughs the
river, however hoarsely it may bark, or however it may fling volumes
of smoke above, like streamers, that belongs to the masculine gender.
Every ricketty yawl or skiff that is battered to pieces by the
tides, belongs to the lovely and ever-to-be-beloved sex. If a pleasure-boat,
with its white sail kissing the wave which its prow proudly
spurns, wins a compliment, it is sure to be uttered after this wise:
'See how finely she sails!&mdash;and</p>

<p class="center">
'<em>She</em> walks the water like a thing of life.'<br />
</p>

<p>Is not the male sex somewhat scandalously neglected in this matter?
Why should not a noble ship, daring and adventurous&mdash;a
merchant-<em>man</em>, perhaps an India-<em>man</em>&mdash;belong to the masculine gender?
If <em>it</em> be female, why not be grammatically consistent, and talk
of merchant-<em>woman</em>, and India-<em>woman</em>? If it be necessary that inanimate
structures be sexed, why not do it with some reference to their
qualities? Let a ship be called <em>she</em>, by all means; for a lady is beautiful,
and a ship bearing steadily away over the waters, is beautiful
to look upon, too; and a lady, though not freighted down with bales
and packages by the ton, yet is she burthened with those articles in
the dry-goods line which are worn by <i>the ton</i>. Streamers wave from
the flag-staff of the one, and ribbons flutter gaily from the main-top
of the other. Therefore, let a ship and a woman be of the same sex.
But let there be some limits to the license. We take it, there is
nothing that floats, which looks less like our own dear sweet-heart,
than an old worm-eaten canoe, scooped out of a dead trunk; and
yet, when a paddle is applied to the ugly thing, you look at it and
say, '<em>She</em> moves!'</p>

<p>We admit and feel the romance and propriety of sexing 'the
poetry of heaven.' Blessings be yet again on benighted Egypt, for
she taught us to speak of Osiris and Isis, instead of the sun and
moon! Blessed for ever be the spirit of him who first conceived
the idea of sexing the starry hosts, from the Cynosure to Sirius!
How much more poetical is night in consequence&mdash;especially such
as Moore speaks of in the Epicurean:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">&mdash;&mdash;'Sweet nights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Isis, the pure star of lovers, lights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bridal crescent o'er the holy stream!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All who have been in love, feel that the soft influence which comes
down from the face of Isis is feminine in its witchery. She is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
friendly to love affairs, although Miss Diana, when in Greece, would
have nothing to do with the masculine deities; and although she
banished Calisto, and transformed Acteon, yet did these same Greeks
scandalize the virgin, by reporting that she forgot her fastidiousness
when she was smitten by the charms of an Endymion on the Carian
Mount. To return. We are glad that the poets of the olden time
sexed the stars pretty much as their fancies thought proper, and that
we Christians still perpetuate these beautiful fictions of their mythologies;
for there is a charm in the classical association which now
comes upon the mind, when viewing the heavens, that we should
regret to part with, however heathenish and anti-utilitarian it may be.</p>

<p>The owners of bright eyes have astronomy enough to recognise
Venus, the beautiful star of evening; and yet they perversely and
anti-mythologically call her <em>it</em>, when they should know that <em>she</em> is all
that is now left of that beautiful being of the cestus, who, like a
wreath of foam, was born of a billow near Cythera. Let us be consistent,
and call Venus <em>she</em>, even as we call the moon she, and her
lord and master, 'the eye of the universe,' he. It is proper to speak
of Saturn, and <em>his</em> rings, of Mars, and <em>his</em> belligerent front; and we
should, to be consistent, <em>she</em> Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, every one of
them. Let us also call this great heap of dirt and water which we
tread on, and sail over, and speak of, as our <em>mother</em> earth, feminine.
Our wretchedly-abused planet is spoken of as belonging to no sex
in particular, now-a-days, although she was once called Terra and
Titæa; and then she was a beauty, and a charming one, too, as we
should judge from some of her heart-stealing, bright-eyed daughters.</p>

<p>Poetry demands that we still continue to sex the stars. Let us
regard Jupiter as a great big lubberly fellow, making love to the shy
and bashful Vesta, and waking up jealousy in the bosom of his elder
sweet-heart, Juno. Let us have Mars getting up assignations with
the all-loving Venus, as of old; and Saturn and Pallas felicitating
each other in the manner becoming two heads, the one so full of justice,
and the other of wisdom, as are theirs. How delectable it
would be, to fancy Madame Earth flirting with the long-yeared Herschel,
to the utter astonishment of her neighbor Mercury, who would
either have to live an old bachelor, or look up a mistress in some of
the systems which revolve in the far-off regions of space!</p>

<p>Our imagination has run riot long enough through the heavens;
and we therefore return back to our starting-place, the earth. We
were speaking of the incongruity of the sexual designations now in
vogue. Why is it, that once introduced, the system of sexing things
was not carried out farther? Why not give sex to a tree, a carriage,
a wind-mill, and our pantaloons, as well as to a yacht, a watch, and
every scrabbling village in the land? We love to think upon the
Mississippi as the 'Father of Waters,' and the Ohio as '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La belle
Riviere</i>;' for to the masculine strength and stature of the one, we offer
our admiration, and to the feminine beauty and grace of the other,
we have yielded up our heart.</p>

<p>We were speaking, before we got on this mad-cap digression, of
the miseries in which the editorial fraternity in general, and Frank
Thornton in particular, were sometimes plunged, by ill-timed demands
for that bane of the craft called 'copy.' At such times, Frank would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
disenchant himself of his fond visions, pick up his pen, arrange his
paper, and&mdash;think, or try to think, of a subject. He would look
over the newspapers for topics; whip up his brain for a suggestion,
or look out at the window, and seeing his friend James Summers,
who prided himself on being a man of the world, he would conclude
to write an article on men of the world in general, much after the
manner of the fragment below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'<span class="smcap">Fielding</span> says, that in order to understand men, it is necessary
that one should be born with a genius for that purpose.' Your men
of the world think so too; hence, they are the favorites of nature,
and as such, are superior to ordinary mortals, and have a right, in
consequence, to look down on inferiority. We are not going to upset
Fielding, Bulwer, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et id omne genus</i>; we only say, that we detest the
boast and swagger which your men of the world take upon themselves
as a natural right, peculiar to those who come into the world with an
extra eye to read that volume of mysteries, the human heart, locked
up, like the ark of old, from the vision of the vulgar.</p>

<p>'Your man of the world is the most bustling of bodies, and looks
like Atlas with the globe incumbent on his shoulders. His lips form
an oracle of human wisdom, and it is rank profanity to question
aught that emanates from so holy a source. His contempt for
inferior understandings is most supreme; and his humor, like a
foaming cataract, flows and boils with sublime rage, if impertinence
dare question his profundity, or contest his right to monopolize the
gleams of knowledge which light up the human mind. He is the
greatest and most orthodox of bigots, and takes good care that the
stultified head of heresy be scathed by the lightnings of his indignation.
He uses old saws with a wink; and if he chooses to bless you
with a squint, you are unpardonable, if you do not cheer him with a
smile. He is a stickler for antiquity, and hates smooth chins and black
heads, for their greenness and folly. He is the repository of all the
fragments of wisdom that are left of shipwrecked ages, which have
floated down on the stream of time. He gathers together the bits
and ends of sayings which go to make up the traditionary lore of a
country; and this unbooked knowledge renders him sager than a
man of much reading. In fine, your man of the world is a very great
man, and is to be respected, whether he discourses of the evangelists
at a horse-race, or flourishes political eloquence, and that Helicon
which inspires it, a beer-mug, in the unquiet recesses of some venerable
ale-house.</p>

<p>'This may be called an 'outline in pencil' of a man of the world,
when the shadows of fifty years or so are upon him; when he has
exhausted the fountains of his wild blood, and turned out sage and
philosopher. A man must run a long and labyrinthine gauntlet,
under the scourge of the vices, before he can aspire to the character.
Of course, it is right that such an one should usurp the throne of
wisdom, as his shoulders have been legitimately invested with the
purple of sin. The right to rule can only be predicated on a youth
of prostitution, a manhood of degradation, and an old age of impenitence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>'Perhaps you may have seen a man of the world, under the shadow
of a tavern sign-post, discoursing wisdom to the simple-hearted villagers.
He has the infallible marks of a truly great man legible in
his face; bloated veins, and an indented excrescence surmounting his
nose, and flaming like a fiëry beacon with the condensed heat of
unnumbered barrels of all 'proofs.' His libations to Bacchus have
given a remarkable clarification to the emanations of his intellect, as
is discoverable in the vividness with which his wisdom glares on the
understandings of all who hear him. A flippant attorney is, perhaps,
at his side; and the worthy twain discuss national policies, while the
unsophisticated lookers-on stand mute, admiring the prodigious display
of genius. The village magistrate imbibes ideas which astonish
his natural stock of well-behaved ones, that never strayed beyond
the hill-top in the distance, or flew off on a wild goose-chase after the
phantoms of knowledge. The man of the world lays down his
positions, and fortifies them with the maxims he learned from his
predecessor, who sleeps in the church-yard. The pettifogger capitulates
to his invincible adversary, and acknowledges in him one whose
dogmas it were irreverent to doubt.</p>

<p>'Your man of the world never goes to church. His own experience
furnishes principles for the government of men, vastly superior
to all that Christianity ever dreamed of. He has an intuitive perception
into the minds of children, and can predict, to a nicety, the
amount of power their intellectual machinery will be able, in time
to come, to generate. He believes that scarcely an honest man, beside
himself, lives; and as to women, they are not a whit better than
they ought to be. Lastly, your man of the world is the chief light
of the world, and when he dies, the heavens will be hung in gloom,
and the edifice of society will fall into dilapidation; as he, while
living, was its chief prop and support.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the afternoon of the day on which the above article appeared,
Mr. James Summers, who sat for the portrait of the 'Man of the
World,' ordered his paper to be stopped, as he could not 'conscientiously
patronize one devoted to Billingsgate interests, and edited
by a person who had evidently received a diploma for his proficiencies,
from the college of Saint Giles!'</p>

<p>This is a specimen of one class of miseries to which editors are
subject. They rack their weary brains for subjects; and when they
dissect them properly, it frequently happens that some subscriber,
who fancies himself aggrieved, says, with poor Dennis the critic,
'That means <em>me</em>!'&mdash;and forthwith sends in a peremptory order to
have 'his paper discontinued.' And thus the editor not only loses
some one's friendship, but, what is of more importance, his subscription.</p>

<p>Subscribers! one word to you. Support your editor through his
difficulties; and whatever else you neglect, be sure you do not forget
to pay for your intellectual provant; that is, if you would pass decently
through this world, and reach heaven at last!</p>

<h2><a name="RANDOM_PASSAGES" id="RANDOM_PASSAGES">RANDOM PASSAGES</a></h2>

<p class="center">FROM ROUGH NOTES OF A VISIT TO ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, FRANCE, SWITZERLAND, AND GERMANY.</p>

<p class="p2 center">NUMBER FOUR.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Paris, August, 1836.</span>&mdash;After due deliberation respecting the
various routes, viz.: first, by Southampton to Havre, and up the
Seine; second, by Brighton and Dieppe; third, by steam-boat direct
to Calais, or Boulogne; fourth, (the older and most frequented,) by
Dover and Calais, or Boulogne; I chose the latter; and in order to
be in Paris before Saturday evening, (to-day is Wednesday,) took
my outside seat in the night coach to Dover. It was a fine evening,
and as we rode out of London through 'the main artery of the right
hand of the world,' Charing-Cross, down Whitehall and Parliament-street,
over Westminster bridge, and through the villages of Deptford
and Greenwich, I had the finest sunset view of the great metropolis,
which I had yet seen. A glorious full-moon rose soon after we
took leave of the more dazzling luminary, and of course the ride in
such an evening was most agreeable. We passed through Gravesend,
a bustling and noted town on the Thames, and our course lay for
some distance along the margin of the river. At eleven, we stopped
for supper at Rochester. The night which looked so promising, was
not to be very delightful; a change came over the face of it, in the
shape of a cold, thick fog; moreover, that useless and annoying animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
y'clept 'the guard,' kept us awake by a hideous bellowing with
a long tin-horn; and altogether, I was abundantly satisfied with my
first experiment in riding all night. Day-light came at last, just as
we were entering the ancient and honorable town of Canterbury, as
weary pilgrims as ever went there in the days of worthy old Chaucer.
The cathedral is entirely surrounded by ordinary dwelling-houses,
and the massive entrance was at this hour of course closed. We
could only get a glimpse of its fine towers. At six <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, we were
set down at the 'Ship Hotel,' at Dover, and only had to pay five shillings
more than the regular fare, beside three shillings to the guard,
etc., for keeping us awake, and two shillings more for porters, ladders,
etc., to the boat, a pigmy affair, y'clept the Britannia, on board of
which we <i>descended</i>, after a poor breakfast at the hotel; and in a few
minutes we were rapidly receding from the 'white cliffs of England.'
The hills along this coast appear to be entirely of chalk, and from a
short distance, the shore looks as if partly covered with snow. The
castle and heights tower above the town, and the latter give it the
appearance of our Brooklyn. The morning was brilliant and cloudless,
and the sea scarcely ruffled. So we glided over this far-famed
and much-dreaded channel as gently as we should cross from New-York
to Jersey City, only taking somewhat longer time to do it.
Before we had lost sight of Dover, the coast of 'La Belle France'
was very distinct; indeed the two coasts may always be seen from
each other, in clear weather. We had three or four baskets of carrier-pigeons
on board, which were liberated at intervals, to announce
our progress. They are used to communicate important intelligence,
and never fail of arriving at their destination in about ten minutes.</p>

<p>The distance from Boulogne to Dover is forty miles. After a
voyage of three-and-a-half hours, we made the bustling town of
Boulogne, which is prettily situated on the open sea-coast, at the
head of a small bay. On an eminence near the town, is a conspicuous
monument, commenced by Napoleon to commemorate his (intended)
conquest of England,(!) and completed by Louis XVIII.,
to commemorate Napoleon's downfall!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> sailed up between two long and excellent wood piers, filled
with expecting friends, porters, police, soldiers, custom-house officers,
etc., and stepping for the first time on the soil of Europe, at least of
the continent, I was escorted by a companion through the eager
crowd, amid the clamorous calls of the commissioners, 'Hotel du
Nord? Hotel D'Angleterre? Hotel D'Orleans? Portmanteau, Monsieur?'
and all in a strange tongue. What a jabbering! At a little
bureau on the quay our passports were received, and we were permitted
to proceed without any personal examination, the commissioner
of our hotel (D'Orleans,) taking charge of our luggage, which
he 'passed' in an hour, without giving us a word of trouble; but we
soon found we were not to escape vexations, for the seats in the diligences,
had been engaged for four days to come! This is especially
provoking, in such a place as Boulogne. But repining avails not.</p>

<p>This is the second of 'Le Trois Jours,' and the tri-colored flags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
are displayed from every house in town, giving the streets a gay
and lively face. This is a remarkably clean and orderly place, and
in this respect forms a strong contrast to its rival, Calais. It is a
famous sea-bathing place, and during the summer, English residents
and visitors form one third of the whole population. Indeed, the town
is very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Anglaise</i>&mdash;more so, they say, than any other in France.
But still there is enough to remind a novice that he is really in
another country, in the old world. The military on the docks and
in every street; the poor women, bare-footed and bare-headed, performing
the labor of beasts of burthen, being in fact the public porters,
and thankful for the chance of carrying your luggage for a few sous;
the incessant jabbering in a strange tongue, (strange, alas! to me,)
'for even the children here,' as one sagely remarked, 'talk very good
French;' the streets without side-walks, and the picturesque figures
in them; the immense clumsy diligences, arriving and setting off in
cautious pace; the street harpists and music-grinders, (of which
we have abundant specimens,) etc. The hotels form about one-fourth
of all the buildings of the town, and are all crowded. Mine
host has a summer pavilion on the banks of the sea, commanding an
extensive view of the English coast, etc., and very similar to that at
Rockaway, (L. I.,) and to this we are sent in a barouche to dine at
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d'hôte</i>, in a large airy hall, which accommodates one hundred
or more. The company, being mostly English, seemed rather
awkward in this novel mode of dining; and there was no general
conversation at the table. My neighbour stared with astonishment
when he found I was not English, and still more so that I was an
American, 'the first he had ever seen;' and he looked as tickled as
if he had seen an ourang-outang. The shore before the pavilion is
covered with little bathing-cars, which are drawn into the water by
horses, and there is a handsome assembly-hall near by, for the bathers.
After dinner, walked up to the 'barriers,' or ramparts, which surround
an elevated part of the city, and serve both for fortification and
a public promenade. The view from them is very fine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Friday.</span>&mdash;A rainy day, and the review and ceremonies in the
church are given up. Strangers at the hotels have been invited by
the mayor to a grand ball at the 'Salle du Spectacle,' or theatre, this
evening. A band of music at the pavilion at dinner. Went to the
theatre; great crowd, nine-tenths spectators; much like our Masonic
Hall balls, except that there is no room to dance. The élite of the
town displayed their best, but the majority were English. It was to
be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">très selecte</i>, and has been the town-talk for a week; yet my companion
said, with great surprise, that of one of the prettiest of the
dancers he had bought his gloves. Made an appointment to meet
him at Amiens cathedral, at five <span class="smcap">A. M</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saturday.</span>&mdash;A most vexatious mistake of my own has lost me my
seat again, and I must endure idleness and ennui, in this purgatory,
twenty-four hours longer. Horrors! What <em>shall</em> I do? Wandered
into a museum, and killed an hour. Bought 'Diary of Desennuyée.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Miserable trash! Changed it for Mrs. Trollope's 'Paris and the
Parisians;' precious little better. The longest day I have known this
two years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">August 31st.</span>&mdash;Found myself actually mounted on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rotonde</i> of
a French diligence, and proceeding, at the pace of six or seven
miles an hour, toward Paris. Splendid morning; and the roads are
thoroughly sprinkled by the late rain. The diligence has been recently
much modified, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'Anglaise</i>, and I perceived but little difference in
the mode or rate of travelling. This one has two outside rear
seats, or the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rotonde</i>; the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">banquette</i>, over the conducteur's seat in front;
and the interior, divided into three apartments. The front is called the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</i>, and is the highest price. The conducteur is a respectable
personage, who overlooks the whole team, delivers the passports,
etc., and the fee to him, and the postilion, is always regular, and
paid in advance. (The fees to waiters at hotels in France are always
charged in the bills; so there is one annoyance well rid of.)</p>

<p>The road to Paris, by Montreuil, Abbeville, and Beauvais, is flat,
stale, and unprofitable. There is little to be seen but wheat-fields
and pastures, and here and there a bit of a hut, with the philanthropic
announcement, 'Loge au pied et un cheval;' which is equivalent, I
presume, to the similar English establishments' sign, 'Entertainment
for man and horse.' Montreuil is an antique and strongly-fortified
town, entirely surrounded by a high wall, and several out-posts. Here
we stopped to dine. Abbeville, the next, is the largest town on the
route, and quite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">continental</i> in its appearance. It was a fête-day,
and the whole population were amusing themselves in the streets,
some with a dancing monkey, others listening to a buffoon, or improvisatrice.
Then we passed through Airaines, Granvilliers, and Marseilles
to Beauvais, famous for its siege in 1472 by the Duke of Burgundy,
which was raised by the heroic Jean Hanchette, whose memory
is still honored by an annual festival. Here we took a good breakfast,
for which our night ride had created an excellent appetite.
Passing then through the small villages of Puiseux, Blaumont, Sur-Oise
and Marseilles, we came to Saint Dennis, the burial-place of the
kings of France, and from thence proceeded through a broad,
straight, dusty avenue, to the capital, without having any general
view; and were set down at the bureaux of the Messageries
Royal, where our luggage was slightly examined, and I was then
escorted, by a young companion, to the Hotel De Lille et d'Albion,
opposite the Palais Royal. Dined at the table d'hôte, with a
company of thirty, all English. Got a cab and rode over one of the
bridges to find my quandam yankee doctor. Find it necessary to be
in earnest now about learning French. My ignorance is rather
awkward, but still it is not impossible to make myself understood;
and 'necessity is the mother of invention.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">August 2nd.</span>&mdash;Hired a guide, or interpreter, to show me the
localities, and assist me in my business. In the city in general, I am
disappointed. The narrow, filthy streets, with gutters in the centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and without side-walks, and the antique and irregular buildings, do not
realize my notions of gay, elegant Paris. But the extent and magnificence
of the <em>public</em> buildings, palaces, gardens, parks, boulevards,
etc., are enough to atone for the dirty streets. The general view of
the city, from one of the centre bridges, (the atmosphere being
wonderfully clear and transparent,) is grand and imposing in the
extreme. The luxurious and superb architecture of the Louvre,
Tuilleries, Luxembourg, and Palais Royal, and the <em>immense extent</em>, as
well as the great beauty and elegance, of the gardens and parks, connected
with these places, must astonish even the most sanguine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">August 4th.</span>&mdash;Took lodgings with Dr. &mdash;&mdash; in Rue D'Enfer,
opposite the garden of the Luxembourg, for three objects, namely:
to have a guide to the city; to learn French from him and the talkative
landlady, and for economy's sake, for I pay but seven and a half
francs a week for a snug room with attendance, in a good situation,
and can have breakfast (such as it is) for fifteen sous.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">6th.</span> Having disposed of most of my business, I commenced '<i>lionizing</i>.'
First, I walked over Pont des Arts, through the Louvre and
the Tuilleries, to the Garden of the Tuilleries, which, I need not
say, is laid out on a scale of great extent and magnificence, and is
profusely adorned with fine statues, and groups in bronze and marble.
The number and variety of the noble walks in this garden are
truly astonishing. And it is not less so, that the finest statuary should
be so liberally exposed to the public, without the least guard or protection,
and yet none of it is ever injured. Passed through Place de la
Concorde, (late Place Louis XVI.;) and the Champs Elysées, where
they were removing the lamps, etc., used in the late fête of the three
days; and walked up the broad and noble avenue to the Arc de
Triomphe, which was completed a few days since, and is one of the
most conspicuous, and most admired ornaments of the capital. I will
send you a printed description, which will save me a great many words.
Suffice it to say, that the most extravagant epithets will not give you
too high an idea of it. It is of white marble, adorned with exquisite
bas-reliefs, and is so immense in extent and height, that from the Pont
Neuf, about three miles distant, it is conspicuous far above the tall
trees of the Champs Elysées, and all the surrounding objects.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Returned</span> to the Louvre, and spent the forenoon in its celebrated
Musée and Gallery of Paintings. This gallery is one thousand three
hundred and thirty feet long, and would reach from Broadway to
Wooster-street! The ceiling is oval, and is elegantly gilded and
adorned. The perspective of the gallery is much like that of Thames
Tunnel, and the farther end appears to be only three or four feet
high. As to the paintings, I have marked in the catalogue those
which particularly struck me, and no farther description would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>worth while. The gallery of ancient sculpture is of course intensely
interesting, and contains one of the finest collections in the world.
(See Madame Starke.) Walked up to the Boulevards, which, with
Rue Rivoli, Rue Castiglione, and perhaps two or three others, are
the only streets which do credit to the city. The Boulevards are
quite modern; and when the trees are matured, and the building
finished, they will be much more beautiful than now. The Boulevard
des Italiens is the handsomest. In the Boulevard Conti, is the
superb church of <i>St. Madeline</i>, the interior of which is not yet completed.
It is like the <i>Bourse</i>, or Exchange, on the model of a Grecian
temple, and is built of white marble, surrounded with exquisite
Corinthian pillars, and ornamented with bas-reliefs. In the Place
Vendome, nearby, is the celebrated column (on the model of Trajan's,)
erected by Napoleon to commemorate his victories. What a gigantic
mind was Napoleon's! It is displayed as much in the monuments,
edifices, and public works, which he planned and executed, as in his
ambitious projects for the conquest of Europe. This column is made
of cannon taken in his battles, and you must see it, in order to understand
the difficulty as well as grandeur of such a project.</p>

<p>Returned to my room before dark; for recent examples have shown,
that it is not quite safe to be out alone, late in the evening, in the
streets of Paris. Several persons have been attacked and robbed,
and one or two killed, in this neighborhood, within a few days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday.</span>&mdash;Went to St. Sulpice, which is ranked as the second
church in Paris, next to Notre Dame. It is Roman Catholic of course,
for there are but four or five Protestant churches in all Paris! The
front of St. Sulpice is very grand and imposing, but the rest is not
particularly so. The interior is spacious and lofty, but far less elaborately
finished and decorated than the cathedrals of England. There
are large niches around the walls, enclosed with a railing, and adorned
with fine paintings, an altar etc., which seemed to be private or family
chapels. Several companies of children, apparently belonging to
schools, were led into the church by priests in black cloth robes.
These priests were reading the service in various parts of the church,
and in the niches, to groups of ten or twenty; but the principal one
was before the grand altar, which was richly adorned, and contrived
for effect, which I cannot describe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">7th.</span>&mdash;Went to Versailles, where there was to be a grand review,
etc. The Doctor, a medical student, a New-Orleans gentleman,
and myself, took a hack together, and started off about eleven o'clock.
All the world had gone or were going; the vehicles of all sorts, from
the superb barouche of the nobility, to the go-cart of the market folks,
were innumerable. Rode along the Quai des Tuilleries and the
Champs Elysées. Passed Saint Cloud, the favorite residence of
Napoleon, and the scene of the bloodless revolution which gave him
the government of France. Near the palace, is a column for telegraphs,
by which Napoleon communicated with Paris. A certain
light was a signal that he would see nobody. Neither lord nor lady
must approach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arrived</span> at Versailles at one. Review just over! The palace here
is immensity personified. It can hardly be comprehended. From
the magnificent gardens, the view of it is superb. These gardens
will more than realize the most brilliant fairy scene of the Arabian
Nights. They extend <em>several miles</em> in each direction; laid out with
the most perfect neatness and order; and this is their only fault.
There is too much trimming&mdash;too much exactness. If they were a
little more like the wild beauty of nature, they would please my eye
as well. Statuary, of all sorts, is liberally disposed throughout these
vast grounds; noble avenues intersect each other at half-angles in the
gardens and park; and in these the trees are so placed and trimmed
as to form a grand triumphal arch; while the squares between are
occupied by fountains, curiously devised, or by a bed of flowers.</p>

<p>'All the world and his wife' were there. Suddenly, there was a
pressing toward one of the grand avenues. It was to see the King
of Naples, who is now here on a visit to his aunt, the Queen of the
French. The king and the French queen were in an open car, accompanied
by two good-looking youths, about sixteen and eighteen,
(the Dukes of Nemours and Orleans,) and the two princesses, rather
pretty, and dressed with taste and marked simplicity. An elderly
gentleman, next to the King of Naples, was said to be his minister
or guardian, and he looks as if he needed one. He is a mustachioed,
dandyish-looking fellow, and stared through his quizzing glass in a
style quite amusing. The people took off their hats, as the car passed,
but there was not a whisper of applause or enthusiasm.</p>

<p>On our return, just as we stopped at the park of St. Cloud, the
French king's carriage came up, kept as close as a prison; and in a
few minutes, the queen and he of Naples arrived, and stopped in the
park to change horses; so we had a chance to scan them all very
closely. The queen might have been handsome once, but she certainly
is not now. She bowed repeatedly to some one by the carriage;
but not a word was uttered, which appeared very strange.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">10th.</span>&mdash;My way to Galignani's reading-room, every morning, is
through the portico of the hall of the celebrated French Institute,
over the Pont des Arts, and through the quadrangles of the Louvre
and Palais Royal. What a world in miniature, (and not on a very
small scale either,) is this Palais Royal! A palace that would <i>cover
two or three of our squares</i>, in the heart of the city, was converted by
its proprietor, the late Duke of Orleans, into an immense bazaar; the
entrance from every part being from the interior court, which is a
long promenade of itself, adorned with rows of trees, fountains, and
gardens. The lower floor of the palace is divided into stores, in the
arcade fashion, in which are displayed every article, almost, which can
be imagined or desired, for use or ornament. The jewellers are the
most numerous. There are, I should think, at least three or four
hundred of these shops on the first floor, and they each rent for four
thousand francs per annum. The second floor is occupied by cafés,
reading-rooms and by gambling-establishments, or 'hells,' and the
upper stories by characters of all sorts, male and female. In short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
there is a specimen of every thing, good and bad, in this Palais
Royal; and even the bad is made so alluring and dazzling, that altogether,
it is no very difficult matter for an unwary novice there to rid
himself of his superfluous cash. The imposing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'&oelig;il</i> of the
palace and gardens you can imagine better from the prints, than
from any description.</p>

<p>Near the Bourse, is the Halle au Blé, an immense circular building,
the dome of which is nearly as large as that of the Pantheon at
Rome.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my ramble to-day, I dropped into a church which I found to be
that of Saint Roch, one of the most beautiful in Paris. Like Saint
Sulpice, it has numerous private altars in the enclosures around the
walls, which are adorned with fine paintings. Near the main altar,
there is a representation of the sepulchre, made with real stones, and
roughly placed in the supposed manner of the original, and a group
of statuary, as large as life, representing the entombment. It is so
well done, that the credulous devotees who were kneeling before it
seemed to think it was reality. Near it is a representation of Mount
Calvary and the Crucifixion, not painted, but contrived to produce a
most singular effect.</p>

<p>In the aisle of Saint Roch, I met an English lady, and her three
daughters, whom I had seen at Boulogne. Having travelled with the
lady's husband, but not having been formally introduced, I passed
without speaking to them. The lady turned and spoke to me, and
politely invited me to call at her hotel. I mention this, as proving
that the English are not always so tenacious about formal introductions
as they have been represented.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Tuesday, 9th.</span>&mdash;Walked before breakfast to the Jardin des Plants,
where botanical students have the privilege of studying all the immense
variety of specimens which are there displayed, in a garden
of three-fourths of a mile long. A small hill in the centre is
surmounted by a little bronze temple, from which there is a good
prospect. On this hill are two or three <i>Cedars of Lebanon</i>, which
are esteemed very rare and valuable; it is a beautiful tree, and quite
<i>oriental</i>. Beside the plants in this establishment, there is a menagerie,
a museum of botany and natural history, etc.</p>

<p>Visited the gallery of the Luxembourg, which is appropriated for
paintings and sculpture by living artists. It was a rich treat. See
catalogue. The garden of the Luxembourg is a beautiful promenade,
but not equal to that of the Tuilleries. Nothing can exceed
the gayety and brilliancy of the scene in these gardens at sunset,
and early in the evening, when the thousands are enjoying the cool
refreshing air, or admiring the fountains and statues. In the Tuilleries,
a sculpture in bronze has been lately put up, representing a lion
crushing a viper or serpent. It seems to attract much attention, as
being emblematical of a strong government putting down all insurrectionary
vipers.</p>

<p>Visited <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notre-Dame</i>. The interior architecture will not compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
with that of York Minster, and other English cathedrals, but it has
a lighter and more cheerful appearance. It is abundantly decorated
with paintings, some of which are very superior. A company of
priests were chanting in the choir, in the most doleful manner imaginable.
Ascended by four hundred steps to the top of the towers,
from which there is a fine view of Paris and the environs. The
clearness of the atmosphere renders the view much better than that
from Saint Paul's. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Palais de Justice</i>, where the courts, etc.,
are held, is near Notre Dame, on the Ile de Cité. The Court of
Cassation are now engaged in the trial of persons lately arrested for
supposed treasonable plots. Poor Louis Phillipe! thine is a throne
of thorns! Thou darest not show thyself in public, lest thy life should
be forfeited! Who does not envy thee! And yet, I have never
learned that the king has merited these attempts on his life. The
government, in spite of some severe laws, has been as liberal as the
character of the people would justify.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque du Roi</i> contains eight hundred thousand volumes,
the largest library in the world. I noticed a work on the topography,
etc., of France, alone, in two hundred and nine large folio volumes!
Connected with the library, is an immense collection of prints, and
of antique medals, cameos, gems, etc. I saw the armour of the Duke
of Sully, Henry IV., and several of the French generals; manuscript
original letters of Racine, Molière, Bossuet, Boileau, Voltaire,
Fenelon, Rousseau, etc.; manuscripts written in the third, fourth, and
fifth centuries, beautifully illuminated; manuscripts in Turkish, Arabic,
Coptic, Egyptian, etc., and paintings from the ruins of Thebes,
probably done before Christ.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> papers announced a review of the troops before the Tuilleries,
by the king, and the King of Naples, but it was changed to the Champs
Elysées, and the King of France was not present. He is said to be
very courageous himself, and it is only the urgent entreaties of his
family and his ministers which keep him so close. He wished to
have the review on the 29th, but they would not permit him. Just
as I was leaving the Garden of the Tuilleries, the king arrived in a
coach-and-six, preceded by a courier, and escorted by a party of
dragoons. He looked out of the carriage and bowed, and I had a
good opportunity to see him. The face was quite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">natural</i>, and very
much like the prints.</p>

<p>This afternoon I visited one of the most curious and interesting
sights in Paris, the manufactory of the celebrated <i>Gobelin Tapestry</i>,
where those copies of the Cartoons of Raphael, exhibited in New-York,
were made. The operation appears perfectly simple, and yet
I cannot understand it. The picture to be copied is hung on the wall
behind the loom; the weaver sits with his back to it, and works on
the <i>back of the tapestry</i>. It is done entirely by hand, and of course
it is very slow work, six years being spent on one piece. There are
about ten or twelve rooms, some of them containing two or three
looms. Several of the pieces now on the looms are very beautiful,
and they are, therefore, very expensive. None but kings and <i>millionaires</i>
can afford them. Annexed to the tapestry rooms, there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
manufactory of carpets, of a most princely description, uniting the
thickness and durability of the Turkey carpets, with the softness and
elegance of the Wilton. The colors and patterns are really superb.
The carpets are always made in one piece. These, also, are such as
the most wealthy only can buy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Pantheon</span>, once called the Church of Saint Genevieve, is a
sort of national monument. It is an elegant building, in the form of
a cross, supported within and without by Corinthian pillars. The
dome is particularly lofty and beautiful. On the walls, are four gilt
tablets, on which are inscribed the names of two hundred and
eighty-seven citizens, killed in the revolution of 1830. The crypt is
fitted for the purpose of receiving monuments of distinguished persons.
Our guide, with a lantern, escorted us to this subterranean
region, where we 'meditated among the tombs.' Suddenly
he came to a statue, and raising the lantern to the face, discovered
to us features expressing a scornful sneer, which made me start.
It was a statue of Voltaire. While there, another party came in,
preceded by the guide and lantern, and dodging every now and then
from behind the pillars of the crypt, it seemed like being in the
regions of the dead. In the evening, went to see the celebrated
<i>Taglioni</i>, at the Académie Royale de Musique, being her first appearance
for some time. The house was as full as it could be packed,
and I could hardly get a peep; but I saw such dancing as I never
beheld before. It is most appropriately called the 'poetry of motion.'
Visited an exhibition of Sevres porcelain; should like to send home
a set, but it rather exceeds my purse. <i>The Hotel des Invalides</i>, is
the largest building in Paris, if not in the world. It is an asylum
for maimed and superannuated soldiers. The chapel connected with
it, and especially the dome, is much admired, and is considered the
finest thing of the kind in Paris. The old soldiers of Napoleon are
here to be seen in their cocked hats and military dress; some with
one arm, others minus a leg. They are all well taken care of, and
have nothing to do. Near the Invalides, is the Ecole Militaire, and
the Champs de Mars, where one hundred and fifty thousand men have
been paraded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the banks of the river, facing the Place de Concord, is the
Palace of the <i>Chamber of Deputies</i>, or Palace Bourbon. The Hall
of Sitting is in the form of an amphitheatre, the seats raised above
each other. It is very elegant, and even gay, in its decorations. The
front benches are inscribed <i>Ministres</i>. The session of the chamber
does not commence till winter. We were also shown the other
apartments of the palace. Next to this is the Palace of the Legion
of Honor, and farther on is the Hotel des Monnaies, or Mint. This
afternoon, at five o'clock, stepped into an omnibus, in order to be at
Père la Chaise at sunset. It is on an eminence near the barriers of
the city. The street which leads to it was filled with women, who
were making and selling those yellow wreaths, (of which I send you
a specimen,) for the visitors to decorate the tombs of their friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Great numbers of these were placed on the tombs, some fresh, and
others faded and dried. The cemetery is on the same plan as that at
Mount Auburn, or rather Mount Auburn is on the plan of this. There
are no less than thirty thousand tombs here, displaying every variety
of taste and whim in the style and pattern, and filling a space of some
hundred acres, the walks through which form quite a labyrinth,
insomuch that the guides charge three francs to go through it, which
I did not choose to pay. I found the tombs of Abelard and Helöise,
Molière and La Fontaine (which are side by side, and very simple,
and covered with names of visiting scribblers,) Rousseau, La Bruyère,
La Place, (the author of Mécanique Celeste,) Moreau, Volney, (a plain
pyramid,) and several other distinguished names. Many of the monuments
are very splendid, particularly that of General Foy, and others
which I cannot recollect. The inscriptions are as various as the monuments.
Some are very simple: 'à mon père;' 'à notre cher ami;'
'à notre petite Julie,' etc. Many of the monuments are little chapels,
with altars, candles, chairs, etc., and some even with paintings; having
an iron door, of open work, so that you can look in and see the
taste and superstition of the founder. It requires a whole day, at
least, to take even a passing view of all the monuments. The view
from the highest ground in the cemetery is very fine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">12th.</span> I had sent a note to Prince Czartoryski, desiring to know if
it was his pleasure that I should call on him. This morning I received
a polite and elegantly-written note, in French, saying: 'Le
Prince Czartoryski présente ses complimens à Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, et s'empresse
de le prévenir qu'il aura le plaisir de l'attendre chez soi,
demain à 11 h. dans la matinée.' Ce 10 Aöut, 1836. 25 Faubourg
du Roule.'</p>

<p>I did not receive it till the day after that designated, but still I
went. There did not seem to be even a porter or a servant on the
premises. An old man escorted me up stairs, and knocking, the door
opened where a good looking gentleman was writing. I was at a loss
to know whether he was the prince or not, but he seemed to expect
me. 'Monsieur &mdash;&mdash;?' 'Oui, Monsieur.' He escorted me to the next
room, and took my card into another. In a few minutes, a noble-looking
man, about fifty-five, came out, and taking my hand, was 'very
glad to see Mr. &mdash;&mdash;;' 'walk in;' and so I was seated on a plain
gingham-covered sofa, with the Prince Czartoryski. The apartments,
furniture, etc., are plain almost to meanness, and the prince's pantaloons
themselves looked as if they had been washed five or six times;
a fact which I consider highly creditable to him. He has decidedly
one of the finest, noblest countenances I ever saw. It is expressive
at once of dignity, energy, and benevolence. It indicates a contempt
of every thing mean.</p>

<p>I must confess I felt rather awkward in this my first tête-à-tête
with a prince. It was so hard to have to say 'your highness' at every
sentence, that I finally dropped it entirely, and answered yes, Sir, or
no, Sir. He evidently expects this form, but does not insist upon it.
He inquired about the condition of his countrymen in the United
States; if they had obtained employment; if they conducted themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
well; what gentlemen had interested themselves for them.
He had not heard of Mr. Wilder, and told his secretary to take down
his name. He asked if any association for the Poles existed in
New-York, and if one could not be formed; if the Americans were
not rather partial to Russia, and thought she had done right. This
I answered very warmly, and said that, on the contrary, our country
had watched with astonishment the conduct of the other powers of
Europe in not interfering in behalf of Poland. That the wrongs of
Poland were a favorite theme for our school-boys and school-girls.</p>

<p>After a conversation of half an hour or more, I took leave, the
prince inviting me very cordially to call on him when I returned to
Paris. The morning papers state that 'the government (of France)
yesterday made an application to Prince Czartoryski for three hundred
Poles to go to Spain'&mdash;for which 'party,' I did not notice.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHIEF_OF_HIS_TRIBE" id="THE_CHIEF_OF_HIS_TRIBE">THE CHIEF OF HIS TRIBE.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A SKETCH OF THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JOHN THOMAS TUMBLER, JR.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">And</span> here let me charge you, my son, that you consider nothing which bears the
image of God beneath your notice, or unsusceptible of valuable lessons. The beggar
imploring alms at your hands, the unhappy victim of vice, or the prey of evil passions,
may speak with a voice so loud, that during your whole life, the monitory tones shall
not wholly die away in your ear.'</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Magnus Gonsalva.</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> primary study of all mankind ever has been, and ever will be,
the end by which they may attain happiness. All our energy, all our
reason, and all our ingenuity, are directed to the prosecution of this
one common object; but with what success, we leave those to answer
who have grown old in the game of human life. Our existence is
commenced and continued in its pursuit. We toil in its chase, from
birth until death, with the most assiduous and unceasing application.
But do we obtain it, at last? Go ask the worn-out debauchee, or the
chartered libertine. Go ask the rich man in his castle, or the poor
man in his hut. Ask the faded beauty, or the blooming girl. Ask
the monarch, the mendicant, the world, if they have yet enjoyed one
hour of real happiness&mdash;one hour, unalloyed by the remembrance of
the past, or the fears of the future. It is, in truth, a shadow as intangible
as our own; an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> of our being. But ah! we cannot
discover this until too late. When death is about to drop the curtain
upon the closing scene of the drama of life, we may become sensible
of our error; until that moment, we are in chase of a gilded phantom,
that often drags us through paths of guilt and sin, and repaying us
nothing in the end.</p>

<p>Real happiness is far from being an attribute of existence. It is,
in fact, a moral impossibility that they should cöexist; and Reason
never deceives herself so much, as when she deems it is within the
pale of our enjoyment. Do we not know, by actual realization, that
the jewel for which we have labored for years, loses its value with
possession, and becomes scarce worth the purchasing? And though
we may cast it aside, recognising in some other object the El Dorado
of our hopes, does not that too, when obtained, like the fruit upon
the shores of the Dead Sea, resolve to ashes in our grasp?</p>

<p>We may be partially contented, but never perfectly happy; and
oh! if man but knew this, how much of sorrow and remorse would
it not spare him, when the hand of Age is heavy upon him! How
much alleviation would it not bring to the bed of sickness&mdash;how
much of hope to the departing spirit!</p>

<p>Yet, although it is written in the book of destiny, that the principal
aim of our lives shall be for ever perverted, it is not to be supposed
that this disappointment will render us miserable. The evils of existence
act differently upon mankind; and where you will find one who is
made unhappy by the operation of some untoward circumstance,
you will find a second whose equanimity would scarcely be disturbed
by a much more aggravated misfortune.</p>

<p>Among those so happily constituted as to confront adversity with
indifference, may be numbered the hero of this sketch; an individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
whose age was probably three-and-twenty, and whose name was
universally admitted to be John Thomas Tumbler, Jr., his sire bearing
the like Christian appellatives.</p>

<p>Mr. Tumbler, Jr., was an individual whom those in a more elevated
sphere would term a 'loafer.' Now why one body of the human
family should classify another by so impolite a distinction, may be, to
the uninitiated in the ways of the world, a matter of surprise. To us,
however, it is perfectly explicable, since it serves to carry out one of
the immutable principles of our nature, which is &mdash;&mdash;. But no
matter; we will not animadvert; for as well might the wave that
foams at the foot of Gibraltar, essay to destroy the mountain rock, as
we to change, by censure or deprecation, that gigantic and inveterate
evil.</p>

<p>John Thomas Tumbler, Jr. was not rich; on the contrary, he was
very poor, and, indeed, but little versed in the knowledge of the coin
of his country. But John Thomas had that opulence of feeling which
supplies the place of wealth, and which wealth itself cannot at all
times supply; that internal independence, which buoys up the spirit,
and defies adversity. In his youth, he had been industrious, and no boy
was more persevering and successful in researches for old copper,
nails, bits of lead, and such little valuables; but as he verged into
manhood, his ideas expanded, and those pursuits were abandoned,
as vocations too insignificant for one who bore the image of the
universal Creator. In fact, Mr. Tumbler, Jr. considered it undignified
to labor at all, and so determined to lead a life of ease and relaxation.</p>

<p>When first our gentleman came to this resolve, he was tolerably
well attired. His coat, though thread-bare, and somewhat greasy in
the vicinity of the elbows, looked, nevertheless, partially genteel;
and though many parts of it were preserved in a state of adhesion
by divers pins, it was still without that symptom of poverty, a patch.
His breast, at this interesting period of his life, was defended from
the inclemencies of the weather, by a double-breasted velvet vest,
which had been manufactured some twenty years before for the comfort
of some corpulent citizen, and which now hung about Mr.
Tumbler with the graceful foldings of a Roman toga. Of his pantaloons
and hat, we shall say little, save that they were somewhat venerable;
and of his shirt, we can have <em>nothing</em> to say, he having long since
repudiated that garment, as an article of dress totally superfluous.</p>

<p>It was customary with Mr. Tumbler, Jr., in those halcyon days, to
drop (or rather, as he expressed it, 'happen') in the coffee-houses, at
about eleven o'clock, every day, that being the hour when the lunch
was set out for customers. At such times, Mr. Tumbler was frequently
known to make some very odd mistakes, such, for example,
as drinking the liquor of some other individual, who might have been
so negligent as to put his glass down for a moment, while he helped
himself to a mouthful of the eatables. But these little errors are
incident to an absent-minded man, and might have been passed over
unnoticed, had not Mr. Tumbler, on a later occasion, been discovered
in the act of abstracting a handkerchief from the coat-pocket of a
gentleman who was standing at the bar; for which offence he was
very unceremoniously ejected from the premises, with an invitation
from the keeper to call, in future, 'once in a great while.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tumbler was, happily for his circumstances, not a particular
man. He dwelt any where and every where, and might justly be
termed a 'promiscuous' lodger. He had, it is true, a particular stall
in the market-house, which he sometimes occupied at night; but Mr.
Tumbler had serious objections to sleeping there. 'The flies' he
said, 'made it inconwenient in the morning, and the benches was werry
often left dirty, by the negligence of the butchers:' beside, he was
'roused out, o' market mornings, at early day-light, vich was uncommon
uncomfortable!'</p>

<p>He was a constant attendant upon horse-races, and the like gatherings.
He usually repaired thither with a small capital of two or
three dollars, and a 'sweat-cloth,' 'merely,' as he said, 'to occupy
his mind, and turn an honest penny or two.' He was, moreover, an
accomplished thimble-player, and would bet 'twenty-five, fifty, or
seventy-five cents, that no gentlemen could tell where the ball was!'
At a certain cock-fight, Mr. Tumbler was exceedingly vociferous in
his encouragement of a certain white bantam, engaged in the combat.</p>

<p>'Go it my darling!' exclaimed he, looking exultingly upon his
favorite. 'That's the way to tell it, my bully! Give it to him, my
little whitey!'</p>

<p>'Hurra for dat red cock!' said a colored gentleman, looking sideways
at Mr. Tumbler, in a species of defiance.</p>

<p>'Hurra for the white cock!' again ejaculated Mr. Tumbler.</p>

<p>'Hurra for de red cock!' responded his sable adversary.</p>

<p>'A dollar on the white cock!' exclaimed our hero.</p>

<p>'Done! I take dat bet!' answered the colored gentleman.</p>

<p>The stakes were accordingly produced, and deposited in the hands
of a gentleman of rather inelegant appearance, in a rough bell-crowned
hat, who by-the-by was one of Mr. Tumbler's particular friends.</p>

<p>'Hurra for the white cock!' again shouted Mr. Tumbler.</p>

<p>'Hurra for de red cock!' again shouted the colored gentleman.</p>

<p>Presently the red cock gave his white adversary a thrust with his
gaff, which put out one of his eyes, and nearly closed the engagement.
As soon as Mr. Tumbler perceived this, he thrust the spectators
aside, and going close up to the ring, he sung out: 'Hurra for
the red cock, as I said before.' 'What you hurra for <em>dat</em> cock for!'
exclaimed Sambo; hurra for your <em>own</em> cock, 'f you please!'</p>

<p>'Hurra for the red cock, as I said before!' exclaimed Mr. Tumbler,
unheeding the remark of his opponent&mdash;'Hurra for the red
cock!'</p>

<p>At length the white cock was fairly defeated, and Mr. Tumbler
turned to the holder of the stakes, and demanded the money, which
was given him, in spite of the remonstrances of the 'gen'leman o'
color,' who claimed to have won the bet. The conduct of Mr. Tumbler
in this affair appeared certainly not very honorable; but it would
be unjust to censure him, without knowing whether or not he was
in error as to the cock he bet upon. At all events, the subsequent
coldness and self-possession which he maintained, under a strain of
abuse showered upon him by the colored gentleman, was commendable
in the extreme. He listened to it all as mildly as if it had been
a glowing eulogium upon the excellence of his character; and when
the enraged Ethiopian had finished, he turned leisurely upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
heel, and walked away. This was perhaps one of the most striking
illustrations of Mr. Tumbler's mental superiority. It was indeed a
feature of real greatness; for he who conquers his passion, as Mr.
Tumbler evidently did, does more than he who commands armies;
at least so said, I believe, the sage Socrates; an authority which
none of us moderns have presumed to dispute.</p>

<p>There are many inclinations of our youth which are even strengthened
with our years; and a slight tendency to a particular object in
our boyhood, often becomes with us a passion in after life. Mr.
Tumbler had, at a very early age, evinced a particular affection for
saccharine substances, which affection had grown with his growth,
until it became a leading disposition of his character. And even so
late as the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven,
John Thomas Tumbler, Jr. might be often seen in the interior
of a sugar hogshead, assiduously scooping out with his thumb-nail,
and appropriating to the gratification of his palate, such small quantities
of the article as had been left by the improvident grocer in the
crevices of the staves. But, on the other hand, there are predilections
far more dangerous, which we sometimes suddenly conceive,
and of which we become totally unable to divest ourselves. Among
these evils, the greatest is undoubtedly the love of stimulus. Mr.
Tumbler at length became fond of his toddy; and from that moment
we may date his decline. There were, however, palliations to be
admitted for Mr. Tumbler&mdash;excuses which many who plunge into
the vortex of dissipation sadly lack. His was a monotonous life,
void alike of excitement, object, and interest. It was, then, a matter
of course, that he should seek artificial means to supply a natural
deficiency. In fact, this was almost necessary to existence. But
alas! the gratification of this propensity brought on his ruin; and in
the small space of six months, so complete a revolution was effected
in the appearance of our hero, that he could scarcely be recognised
as the same individual who was wont to frequent the market-house
but a very short time before.</p>

<p>One day he was leaning against a post, reflecting upon the expedient
he should next devise to obtain a 'horn,' when his forlorn appearance
attracted the attention of a gentleman, who stopped a moment
to observe more completely his wretchedness. John Thomas
perceived this, and thought it a moment and an opportunity not to
be disregarded. So, crossing the street, he addressed the stranger,
informing him, in moving accents, that he was 'a poor miserable
cre'tur, 'at hadn't had nothing to eat for upwards of some time, and
'at hadn't seen a bed, for God knows when!' The stranger, in consideration
of his distressing situation, gave him a small piece of money;
and the mendicant, after satisfying himself of its value, very politely
invited his benefactor to go and take a drink with him!</p>

<p>It may not be amiss here, to describe the habiliments of John
Thomas, in contrast with the appearance they presented some months
before. The article which adorned his head, would not, at first sight,
have been taken for a hat. The crown and body were not as closely
allied as they had once been. The former now hung back, attached
only by a slight ligament to the latter. Interesting pieces of rim
were here and there observable; and its original color had long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
since been changed to a greasy brown. His coat, the donation of
some charitable Falstaff, might have been altered to have fitted
better, infinitely better. The body hung down some three or four
inches below the hips, while the skirt, as he promenaded, almost
swept the ground. The sleeves were rolled up at the elbows, much
to the prejudice of the appearance of the lining; and the collar
behind formed an admirable barricade for the preservation of the
latter part of Mr. Tumbler's head. In truth, that gentleman himself
was once heard to remark, that 'it was wastly conwenient as a pillow.'
Of his vest we have already spoken; and it needs but to add, that
time had somewhat impaired it, and that although but one button
graced its ample front, it was still a garment not to be deemed
entirely valueless. His pantaloons could not have been derived
from the same source as the coat, for they fitted him with a tightness
which absolutely jeopardized them at every movement, and gave to
his person, as he moved along, the appearance of a huge penguin.
His boots were likewise very venerable, and but for the sake
of appearances, as John Thomas himself very truly observed, he
might as well be entirely bare-footed. The sole of one of them,
however, though but partially attached to the upper, was perfect of
itself; although the big toe protruded from the breach with an obstinacy
truly mortifying to the sensibility of the wearer, who would sit
upon a fire-plug, and contemplate it with that humiliation which we
are all apt to feel on similar occasions. The sole of the other boot
had 'long since vanished,' as Count Rhodolpho sings in 'La Somnambula;'
and the upper, which was immensely capacious, would
sometimes slew so far round, as to disclose to observation the whole
of his right foot. This was a matter of more vexation to him than
the imperfection of its fellow; for he was often obliged to confine
its sides with pieces of twine, in order to keep it in its proper place;
an occupation extremely irksome, and but ill adapted to his easy
propensities.</p>

<p>Mr. Tumbler was not only a lover of music, but was likewise a
professor of the divine art. During the delightful summer evenings,
he would sit for hours on some cellar-door, producing strains from
a jews-harp, whose melody floated enchantingly upon the air, adding
still more to the witchery of the time, and causing a secret wish to
arise, that it might be evening all the year round. There is a sympathy
in music not to be withstood; and when a particular chord is
struck, if it find a unison in human feeling, the sternest heart must
melt at its thrill. Upon a particular moonlight night, our hero
established himself upon a door-sill, and taking out his instrument,
commenced the beautiful and pathetic ballad of 'Lord Lovell and
Lady Nancy.' For a while he played on with no more interest than
a performer usually exhibits in the execution of a piece. At length,
however, he began to revert to the sorrows of the Lady Nancy, and the
tears were seen stealing, one by one, down his countenance. Thought
begat thought, and sympathy begat sympathy, until Mr. Tumbler,
overpowered by his feelings, took the jews-harp from his mouth, and
commenced sobbing like a child. For a full half hour he continued
to weep, and might have kept on for an hour longer, had not a hard-hearted
servant girl emptied a bucket of ancient soap-suds upon him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
from the third-story window. This libation at once cooled his sorrows.
Shaking the unpleasing liquid from his garments, he crossed over to
the market-house, in order to seek that repose which always waits
upon innocence and self-approbation.</p>

<p>We come now to one of the darkest passages of our hero's life;
an event which we chronicle with a tear; and which nothing but an
imperative sense of duty, as faithful biographers, would compel us
to narrate. There breathes not the man, no matter where you may
seek him, whose career has been, in every instance, one of purity,
who can look back upon his past life, without remembering <em>some</em> action
that brings a feeling of remorse, and who can declare upon his honor
that he has done nothing but what has been perfectly justifiable in
the eyes of God and his fellow-men. Why then should it be expected
that Mr. Tumbler should prove an exception to all mankind? It is
not to be&mdash;it ought not to be.</p>

<p>Mr. Tumbler was one day passing along the street, when his attention
was arrested by a stone jug, which he observed beside an awning-post.
He stopped, looked a moment at the vessel, and then at the
pavers who were working in the street, and to whom the jug evidently
belonged. Mr. Tumbler then reflected a moment, turned about
to satisfy himself that no one observed him, picked up the jug, shook
it, reconnoitred again, hesitated an instant, and placing it under his coat,
leisurely walked on. Unfortunately, however, for his success, the
jug was missed. He was seen, suspected, pursued, caught, and
taken by the collar before his honor the mayor. That dispenser of
justice was induced to believe that he was an old offender; and
accordingly ordered his pockets to be examined. But however Mr.
Tumbler might have erred, in regard to the abstraction of the jug,
he was nevertheless innocent of other crimes of the kind; and
nothing rewarded the search, save an onion, and the fragment of a
Bologna sausage. He was, however, in consequence of the affair
on hand, imprisoned in the city gaol for the space of thirty days;
which confinement, we have been informed, he bore with the resignation
of a Christian, and the fortitude of a hero. At length he
was released; but he came out an altered man. His spirits had been
broken down by the disgrace he had suffered, and he now plunged
deeper than ever into dissipation, seeking in its excitement to drive
away the memory of the past. Happy, indeed, would it have been,
had his sensibilities been less refined; but, like the flower which
shrinks from the touch, he avoided all intercourse with his fellow-men,
wrapping himself up in the gloom of his own thoughts, neglecting
his jews-harp, neglecting himself, and neglected by the world.</p>

<p>Not a great while after our hero's release from incarceration, he
might have been observed strolling leisurely along the wharf, with
the manner of one who has no definite object of pursuit, and who is
willing to amuse himself with whatever the time and place might
present. As his eye rolled onward, he espied a cask, upon the head
of which was written, in large black letters, the word '<i>Cogniac</i>.'
But he little thought that fatal word was to him what the hand-writing
upon the wall had been to the mighty Belshazzar. He little
thought that the simple word 'Cogniac' was applied to him, at that
moment, in as terrible a warning as was the 'Mene, mene, tekel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
upharsin!' which foretold to the Chaldean king the destruction of
his life and empire.</p>

<p>He regarded the cask for a moment, and then throwing his right
leg over, he mounted it. Seating himself firmly, he looked briefly
about him. Satisfied that he was unobserved, he very deliberately
drew a large gimlet from his pocket, and commenced boring a hole
in one of the staves, gazing over the river the while, as if attracted by
some interesting object on the opposite shore. When the perforation
was complete, he returned the instrument to his pocket, and
took an additional survey of the premises. Seeing that he was not
watched by any one, he produced the end of a tin tube&mdash;manufactured
expressly for such occasions&mdash;from beneath his vest, and
inserting it in the hole, applied his mouth to the other extremity of
the conductor, which protruded from the upper part of the garment,
and in this manner commenced extracting the contents of the cask.
For the space of an hour, he remained in one position, not even
stirring a limb. At length the curiosity of a passer-by was excited
by his appearance; and going up to the cask, he was surprised to
find a man, as he thought, asleep. The stranger shook him for a
moment, as if to awaken him; and when he relaxed his grasp, our
hero tumbled to the ground. Astonished that the fall did not rouse
him, the stranger stooped down to examine his features. They
were fixed and rigid. He took his hand; it was cold as marble.
He felt for his pulse; but it had ceased for ever. To make use of a
novel phrase, 'the vital spark was extinguished.' Mr. Tumbler had
gone to a land of 'pure spirits;' a place which he often said he
longed to visit; since the spirits he was in the habit of imbibing
here were generally any thing but pure.</p>

<p>Thus died, in the prime of life, John Thomas Tumbler, Jr., a
man whom nature had endowed with many excellent qualities, which
were, however, all perverted by one vicious and unconquerable propensity.
Under more favorable circumstances, he might have proved
an ornament to society. Avoided, on all occasions, by the respectable
of his species; treated with broad indifference, if not contumely;
a subject of jest and ridicule for every body; how can we suppose
he could burst these shackles, and soar to distinction? Emulation
withered beneath the persecution which attended him through life,
and which, we blush to say, did not cease with his death; for the
papers, in noticing his demise, merely remarked, with cruel brevity:
'A loafer was found dead upon the wharf this morning.'</p>

<p class="hang">
<span class="smcap">Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott</span>, Bart. By <span class="smcap">J. G. Lockhart</span>. Part
Second. pp. 198. Philadelphia: <span class="smcap">Carey, Lea and Blanchard</span>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a notice of the first part of these Memoirs, we expressed an intention of renewing
our broken intercourse with them, as they should appear, at intervals. The publication
of two additional parts gives us ample scope for selection; and indeed this is
all that a reviewer, not inclined to iterate, or 'bestow his tediousness' upon the reader,
will be disposed to do. The pages before us are crowded with incidents, and with
characteristic sketches of the personal and literary every-day life of their subject;
and these, in themselves abundantly attractive, are rendered still more so, as we have
already elsewhere remarked, by the pleasant style of the biographer, who will win
enduring fame by this contribution to a literature which he had before not a little
enriched.</p>

<p>Before entering upon our extracts, we cannot avoid remarking, that throughout the
minuter history of the illustrious poet and novelist here presented, we are enabled to
see the great secret of a literary career, unparalleled since the era of Shakspeare,
if he who wrote for all mankind may be said to have had, or to have, an era. He
stands forth, in these volumes, a shining example to all authors who would win a
permanent hold upon the public regard. He <em>studied</em> humanity, and the works of
nature. He did not content himself with portraying the invisible and non-existent,
and with <em>conceiving</em> scenes and personages which have no counterparts in nature or
in common life. He held rapt intercourse with the mountains, rivers, and vales of
Scotland; and he sought the teachings of those natural instructors, the green fields.
His ear was ever open to the 'silent voice of Nature, speaking in forms and colors.'
The humblest peasant was a picture, and his qualities a study; and the lightest shade
of character, in high or low, was not beneath his scrutiny. To this careful perception
of nature, in all its forms and phases, he added a course of reading more various
and extended, we cannot doubt, than any contemporary on the globe. But, unlike
the many who lard their lean books with the fat of other authors, he read only to
digest, and to <em>fuse</em> his mind; hence, his resources were never exhausted, even when
he was a gray soldier in the literary field, wherein he had borne arms so nobly and
so long. How numerous the chaotic fictions, how many the trumpery novels,
how large the amount of still-born poetry, now sunk into waste paper and oblivion,
which might have been saved to the world, had their producers but followed the example
of the author of Waverley! How much worse than useless labor might have
been saved to the thousands who, unable to inform have striven to please, and have
borne their ponderous loads into the literary mart, and expanded them on the stalls of
their hapless publishers! We cannot but hope that, primarily, the publication of
these Memoirs will be widely beneficial to novelists and poets, and secondarily, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the reading public; that they will improve the taste of those authors who are content
to indulge in superficialities merely; to amuse the imagination, and convey infection
to love-sick damsels, without satisfying the judgment, or touching the heart. So mote
it be!</p>

<p>We commence our extracts with a brief history of the Lay of the Last Minstrel, a
poem 'which has now kept its place for nearly a third of a century:'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is curious to trace the small beginnings and gradual development of his design.
The lovely Countess of Dalkeith bears a wild rude legend of Border <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diablerie</i>, and
sportively asks him to make it the subject of a ballad. He had been already laboring
in the elucidation of the 'quaint Inglis' ascribed to an ancient seer and bard of the
same district, and perhaps completed his own sequel, intending the whole to be included
in the third volume of the Minstrelsy. He assents to Lady Dalkeith's request, and
casts about for some new variety of diction and rhyme, which might be adopted without
impropriety in a closing strain for the same collection. Sir John Stoddart's casual
recitation, a year or two before, of Coleridge's unpublished Christabel, had fixed the
music of that noble fragment in his memory; and it occurs to him, that by throwing
the story of Gilpin Horner into somewhat of a similar cadence, he might produce such
an echo of the later metrical romance, as would serve to connect his <i>Conclusion</i> of the
primitive Sir Tristrem with his imitations of the common popular ballad in the Grey
Brother and Eve of St. John. A single scene of feudal festivity in the hall of Branksome,
disturbed by some pranks of a nondescript goblin, was probably all that he contemplated;
but his accidental confinement in the midst of a volunteer camp gave him
leisure to meditate his theme to the sound of the bugle; and suddenly there flashes on
him the idea of extending his simple outline, so as to embrace a vivid panorama of that
old Border life of war and tumult, and all earnest passions, with which his researches
on the 'Minstrelsy' had by degrees fed his imagination, until every the minutest feature
had been taken home and realized with unconscious intenseness of sympathy; so that
he had won for himself in the past another world, hardly less complete or familiar than
the present. Erskine or Cranstoun suggests that he would do well to divide the poem
into cantos, and prefix to each of them a motto explanatory of the action, after the
fashion of Spenser in the Faëry Queen. He pauses for a moment&mdash;and the happiest
conception of the frame-work of a picturesque narrative that ever occurred to any poet&mdash;one
that Homer might have envied&mdash;the creation of the ancient harper, starts to life.
By such steps did the 'Lay of the Last Minstrel' grow out of the Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border.'</p>

<p>"A word more of its felicitous machinery. It was at Bowhill that the Countess of
Dalkeith requested a ballad on Gilpin Horner. The ruined castle of Newark closely
adjoins that seat, and is now indeed included within its <i>pleasance</i>. Newark had been
the chosen residence of the first Duchess of Buccleuch, and he accordingly shadows
out his own beautiful friend in the person of her lord's ancestress, the last of the original
stock of that great house; himself the favored inmate of Bowhill, introduced certainly
to the familiarity of its circle in consequence of his devotion to the poetry of a
by-past age, in that of an aged minstrel, 'the last of all the race,' seeking shelter at the
gate of Newark, in days when many an adherent of the fallen cause of Stewart&mdash;his
own bearded ancestor, <i>who had fought at Killiekrankie</i>, among the rest&mdash;owed their
safety to her who</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'In pride of power, in beauty's bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had wept o'er Monmouth's bloody tomb.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>The profits, to Scott, from the several editions of this poem were £769. The
sales are given as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first edition of the Lay was a magnificent quarto, 750 copies; but this was soon
exhausted, and there followed an octavo impression of 1500; in 1806, two more, one of
2000 copies, another of 2550; in 1807, a fifth edition of 2000, and a sixth of 3000; in
1803, 3550; in 1809, 3000&mdash;a small edition in quarto (the ballads and lyrical pieces being
then annexed to it,) and another octavo edition of 3250; in 1811, 3000; in 1812,
3000; in 1816, 3000; in 1823, 1000. A fourteenth impression of 2000 foolscap appeared
in 1825; and besides all this, before the end of 1836, 11,000 copies had gone forth in the
collected editions of his poetical works. Thus, nearly forty-four thousand copies had
been disposed of in this country, and by the legitimate trade alone, before he superintended
the edition of 1830, to which his biographical introductions were prefixed. In
the history of British Poetry, nothing had ever equalled the demand for the Lay of the
Last Minstrel."</p></blockquote>

<p>Subsequently to a very interesting account of Scott's partnership with Ballantine,
and of his entering actively upon numerous literary projects&mdash;including his editions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of the British poets, Ancient English Chronicles, Dryden, commencement of Waverley,
etc.,&mdash;we find the following account of his personal habits of industry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He rose by five o'clock, lit his own fire, when the season required one, and shaved
and dressed with great deliberation&mdash;for he was a very martinet as to all but the mere
coxcomberies of the toilet, not abhorring effeminate dandyism itself so cordially as the
slightest approach to personal slovenliness, or even those 'bed-gown and slipper tricks,'
as he called them, in which literary men are so apt to indulge. Arrayed in his shooting-jacket,
or whatever dress he meant to use till dinner time, he was seated at his desk by
six o'clock, all his papers arranged before him in the most accurate order, and his books
of reference marshalled around him on the floor, while at least one favorite dog lay
watching his eye, just beyond the line of circumvallation. Thus, by the time the family
assembled for breakfast between nine and ten, he had done enough (in his own language)
'<i>to break the neck of the day's work</i>.' After breakfast, a couple of hours more
were given to his solitary tasks, and by noon he was, as he used to say, 'his own man.'
When the weather was bad, he would labor incessantly all the morning; but the general
rule was to be out and on horseback by one o'clock at the latest; while, if any more
distant excursion had been proposed over night, he was ready to start on it by ten; his
occasional rainy days of unintermitted study forming, as he said, a fund in his favor, out
of which he was entitled to draw for accommodation whenever the sun shone with
special brightness.</p>

<p>"It was another rule, that every letter he received should be answered that same day.
Nothing else could have enabled him to keep abreast with the flood of communications
that in the sequel put his good nature to the severest test; but already the demands on
him in this way also were numerous; and he included attention to them among the necessary
business which must be despatched before he had a right to close his writing-box,
or, as he phrased it, 'to say <i>out damned spot</i>, and be a gentleman.' In turning
over his enormous mass of correspondence, I have almost invariably found some indication
that, when a letter had remained more than a day or two unanswered, it had been
so because he found occasion for inquiry or deliberate consideration."</p></blockquote>

<p>In illustration of the correctness of the remarks which introduce these extracts, we
give the following passage from a letter of an early friend of Scott to his biographer.
It is unnecessary to say, that it is kindred with numerous others which might be
selected:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One of our earliest expeditions was to visit the wild scenery of the mountainous tract
above Moffat, including the cascade of the 'Gray Mare's Tail,' and the dark tarn called
'Loch Skene.' In our ascent to the lake, we got completely bewildered in the thick
fog which generally envelopes the rugged features of that lonely region; and, as we
were groping through the maze of bogs, the ground gave way, and down went horse
and horsemen pell-mell into a slough of peaty mud and black water, out of which, entangled
as we were with our plaids and floundering nags, it was no easy matter to get
extricated. Indeed, unless we had prudently left our gallant steeds at a farm-house below,
and borrowed hill ponies for the occasion, the result might have been worse than
laughable. As it was, we rose like the spirits of the bog, covered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pie</i> with slime,
to free themselves from which, our wily ponies took to rolling about on the heather,
and we had nothing for it but following their example. At length, as we approached
the gloomy loch, a huge eagle heaved himself from the margin and rose right over us,
screaming his scorn of the intruders; and altogether it would be impossible to picture
any thing more desolately savage than the scene which opened, as if raised by enchantment
on purpose to gratify the poet's eye; thick folds of fog rolling incessantly over the
face of the inky waters, but rent asunder now in one direction, and then in another&mdash;so
as to afford us a glimpse of some projecting rock or naked point of land, or island,
bearing a few scraggy stumps of pine&mdash;and then closing again in universal darkness
upon the cheerless waste. Much of the scenery of Old Mortality was drawn from that
day's ride.</p>

<p>"It was also in the course of this excursion that we encountered that amusing personage
introduced into Guy Mannering as 'Tod Gabbie,' though the appellation by
which he was known in the neighborhood was 'Tod Willie.' He was one of these itinerants
who gain a subsistence among the moorland farmers by relieving them of
foxes, pole-cats, and the like depredators&mdash;a half-witted, stuttering, and most original
creature."</p></blockquote>

<p>The subjoined extract will serve to show the great humility with which Scott bore
his literary honors, at a time when he was beleaguered by the importunities of
fashionable admirers. His bearing, says Mr. Lockhart, when first exposed to such
influences, was exactly what it was to the end. The Border Minstrel is writing
from London, whither he had proceeded upon business connected with an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
prospective situation as Clerk of the Edinburgh Sessions, a lucrative and desirable
station:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It will give you pleasure to learn that, notwithstanding some little rubs, I have been
able to carry through the transaction which your lordship sanctioned by your influence
and approbation, and that in a way very pleasing to my own feelings. Lord Spencer,
upon the nature of the transaction being explained in an audience with which he favored
me, was pleased to direct the commission to be issued, as an act of justice, regretting,
he said, it had not been from the beginning his own deed. This was doing the
thing handsomely, and like an English nobleman. I have been very much fêted and
caressed here, almost indeed to suffocation, but have been made amends by meeting
some old friends. One of the kindest was Lord Somerville, who volunteered introducing
me to Lord Spencer, as much, I am convinced, from respect to your lordship's
protection and wishes, as from a desire to serve me personally. He seemed very
anxious to do any thing in his power which might evince a wish to be of use to your
protegé. Lord Minto was also infinitely kind and active, and his influence with Lord
Spencer would, I am convinced, have been stretched to the utmost in my favor, had not
Lord Spencer's own view of the subject been perfectly sufficient.</p>

<p>"After all, a little literary reputation is of some use here. I suppose Solomon, when
he compared a good name to a pot of ointment, meant that it oiled the hinges of the
hall-doors into which the possessors of that inestimable treasure wished to penetrate.
What a <em>good</em> name was in Jerusalem, a <em>known</em> name seems to be in London. If you
are celebrated for writing verses or for slicing cucumbers, for being two feet taller or two
feet less than any other biped, for acting plays when you should be whipped at school,
or for attending schools and institutions when you should be preparing for your grave,
your notoriety becomes a talisman&mdash;'an Open Sesame' before which every thing gives
way&mdash;till you are voted a bore, and discarded for a new plaything. As this is a consummation
of notoriety which I am by no means ambitious of experiencing, I hope I
shall be very soon able to shape my course northward, to enjoy my good fortune at my
leisure."</p></blockquote>

<p>Elsewhere, a friend thus describes his bearing, in the presence of his London entertainers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Scott,' his friend says, 'more correctly than any other man I ever knew, appreciated
the value of that apparently enthusiastic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">engouement</i> which the world of London
shows to the fashionable wonder of the year. During the sojourn of 1809, the homage
paid him would have turned the head of any less gifted man of eminence. It neither
altered his opinions, nor produced the affectation of despising it; on the contrary, he
received it, cultivated it, and repaid it in his own coin. 'All this is very flattering,' he
would say, 'and very civil; and if people are amused with hearing me tell a parcel of
old stories, or recite a pack of ballads to lovely young girls and gaping matrons, they are
easily pleased, and a man would be very ill-natured who would not give pleasure so
cheaply conferred.' If he dined with us, and found any new faces, 'Well, do you want
me to play lion to-day?' was his usual question; 'I will roar, if you like it, to your
heart's content.' He would, indeed, in such cases, put forth all his inimitable powers
of entertainment; and day after day surprised me by their unexpected extent and variety.
Then, as the party dwindled, and we were left alone, he laughed at himself,
quoted, 'Yet know that I one Snug the joiner am&mdash;no lion fierce,' etc.,&mdash;and was at
once himself again.</p>

<p>"He often lamented the injurious effects for literature and genius resulting from the
influence of London celebrity on weaker minds, especially in the excitement of ambition
for this subordinate and ephemeral <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reputation du salon</i>. 'It may be a pleasant gale to
sail with,' he said, 'but it never yet led to a port that I should like to anchor in.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>In relation to the delightful introductory epistles to Marmion, we find the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He frequently wandered far from home, attended only by his dog, and would return
late in the evening, having let hours after hours slip away among the soft and melancholy
wildernesses where Yarrow creeps from her fountains. The lines,</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Oft in my mind such thoughts awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By lone Saint Mary's silent lake,' &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>paint a scene not less impressive than what Byron found amidst the gigantic pines of
the forest of Ravenna; and how completely does he set himself before us in the moment
of his gentler and more solemn inspiration, by the closing couplet,</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Your horse's hoof-tread sounds too rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stilly is the solitude.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But when the theme was of a more stirring order, he enjoyed pursuing it over brake and
fell, at the full speed of his <i>Lieutenant</i>. I well remember his saying, as I rode with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
across the hills from Ashestiel to Newark one day in his declining years: 'Oh, man,
I had many a grand gallop among these braes when I was thinking of Marmion, but a
trotting canny pony must serve me now.' His friend, Mr. Skene, however, informs me,
that many of the more energetic descriptions, and particularly that of the battle of
Flodden, were struck out while he was in quarters again with his cavalry, in the autumn
of 1807. 'In the intervals of drilling,' he says, 'Scott used to delight in walking his
powerful black steed up and down by himself upon the Portobello sands, within the
beating of the surge; and now and then you would see him plunge in his spurs and go
off as if at the charge, with the spray dashing about him.' As we rode back to Musselburgh,
he often came and placed himself beside me to repeat the verses that he had
been composing during these pauses of our exercise."</p></blockquote>

<p>We should be glad to follow the biographer through his account of the production
of 'Marmion,' and to present some of the numerous criticisms which were received
from the various personal friends of the author. Our space, however, will not permit.
The popularity of the poem may be estimated from the fact, that more than
fifty thousand copies of the work were subsequently sold in Great Britain alone.</p>

<p>Scott's personal appearance, at this period, is thus described by Miss Seward:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'On Friday last,' she says, 'the poetically great Walter Scott came 'like a sun-beam
to my dwelling.' This proudest boast of the Caledonian muse is tall, and rather robust
than slender, but lame in the same manner as Mr. Hayley, and in a greater measure.
Neither the contour of his face, nor yet his features, are elegant; his complexion
healthy, and somewhat fair, without bloom. We find the singularity of brown hair
and eye-lashes, with flaxen eyebrows, and a countenance open, ingenuous, and benevolent.
When seriously conversing, or earnestly attentive, though his eyes are rather of
a lightish gray, deep thought is on their lids; he contracts his brow, and the rays of
genius gleam aslant from the orbs beneath them. An upper lip too long prevents his
mouth from being decidedly handsome; but the sweetest emanations of temper and
heart play about it, when he talks cheerfully, or smiles; and in company, he is much
oftener gay than contemplative. His conversation&mdash;an overflowing fountain of brilliant
wit, apposite allusion, and playful archness&mdash;while on serious themes it is nervous
and eloquent; the accent decidedly Scotch, yet by no means broad. On the whole, no
expectation is disappointed which his poetry must excite in all who feel the power and
graces of human inspiration."</p></blockquote>

<p>We pass the details of his extraordinary literary labors and successes, to present
two or three extracts, which serve to show us the <em>man</em>. A friend of the biographer's
thus compares Scott and Jeffrey, whom he met at a dinner-party in Edinburgh:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'There were,' he says, 'only a few people besides the two lions&mdash;and assuredly I
have seldom passed a more agreeable day. A thousand subjects of literature, antiquities,
and manners were started; and much was I struck, as you may well suppose, by
the extent, correctness, discrimination, and accuracy of Jeffrey's information; equally
so with his taste, acuteness, and wit in dissecting every book, author, and story that
came in our way. Nothing could surpass the variety of his knowledge, but the easy
rapidity of his manner of producing it. He was then in his meridian. Scott delighted
to draw him out, delighted also to talk himself, and displayed, I think, even a larger
range of anecdote and illustration; remembering every thing, whether true or false, that
was characteristic or impressive; every thing that was good, or lovely, or lively. It
struck me that there was this great difference: Jeffrey, for the most part, entertained
us, when books were under discussion, with the detection of faults, blunders, absurdities,
or plagiarisms. Scott took up the matter where he left it, recalled some compensating
beauty or excellence for which no credit had been allowed, and by the recitation,
perhaps, of one fine stanza, set the poor victim on his legs again."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a picture of his fine feeling of domestic attachment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Morritt reached Edinburgh soon after this letter was written. Scott
showed them the lions of the town and its vicinity, exactly as if he had nothing else to
attend to but their gratification; and Mr. Morritt recollects with particular pleasure one
long day spent in rambling along the Esk by Roslin and Hawthornden,</p>

<p class="center">
'Where Johnson sat in Drummond's social shade,'<br />
</p>

<p>down to the old haunts of Lasswade."</p>

<p>"'When we approached that village,' says the memorandum with which Mr. Morritt
favors me, 'Scott, who had laid hold of my arm, turned along the road in a direction
not leading to the place where the carriage was to meet us. After walking some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
minutes towards Edinburgh, I suggested that we were losing the scenery of the Esk,
and, besides, had Dalkeith Palace yet to see. 'Yes,' said he, 'and I have been bringing
you where there is little enough to be seen&mdash;only that Scotch cottage' (one by the road
side, with a small garth); 'but, though not worth looking at, I could not pass it. It
was our first country-house when newly married, and many a contrivance we had to
make it comfortable. I made a dining-table for it with my own hands. Look at those
two miserable willow-trees on either side the gate into the enclosure: they are tied together
at the top to be an arch, and a cross made of two sticks over them is not yet decayed.
To be sure it is not much of a lion to show a stranger; but I wanted to see it
again myself, for I assure you that after I had constructed it, <i>mamma</i> (Mrs. Scott)
and I both of us thought it so fine, we turned out to see it by moonlight, and walked
backwards from it to the door, in admiration of our own magnificence and its picturesque
effect. I did want to see if it was still there: so now we will look after the
barouche, and make the best of our way to Dalkeith.' Such were the natural feelings
that endeared the Author of Marmion and the Lay to those who 'saw him in his happier
hours of social pleasure.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>A brief paragraph or two, descriptive of Scott's feelings when he first called the
now classic grounds of Abbotsford his own, must close our quotations for the present:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As my lease of this place is out, I have bought, for about 4000 pounds, a property in
the neighborhood, extending along the banks of the river Tweed for about half a mile.
It is very bleak at present, having little to recommend it but the vicinity of the river;
but as the ground is well adapted by nature to grow wood, and is considerably various
in form and appearance, I have no doubt that by judicious plantations it may be rendered
a very pleasant spot; and it is at present my great amusement to plan the
various lines which may be necessary for that purpose. The farm comprehends about
a hundred acres, of which I shall keep fifty in pasture and tillage, and plant all the rest,
which will be a very valuable little possession in a few years, as wood bears a high price
among us. I intend building a small cottage for my summer abode, being obliged by
law, as well as induced by inclination, to make this country my residence for some
months every year. This is the greatest incident which has lately taken place in our
domestic concerns; and I assure you we are not a little proud of being greeted as <i>laird</i>
and <i>lady</i> of <i>Abbotsford</i>. We will give a grand gala when we take possession of it, and
as we are very <i>clannish</i> in this corner, all the Scots in the country, from the duke to the
peasant, shall dance on the green to the bagpipes, and drink whiskey-punch." *  *  *
"The same week he says to Joanna Baillie: 'My dreams about my cottage go on; of
about a hundred acres I have manfully resolved to plant from sixty to seventy; as to
my scale of dwelling, why, you shall see my plan when I have adjusted it. My present
intention is to have only two spare bed-rooms, with dressing-rooms, each of which
will, on a pinch, have a couch-bed; but I cannot relinquish my Border principle of
accommodating all the cousins and <i>duniwastles</i>, who will rather sleep on chairs, and
on the floor, and in the hay-loft, than be absent when folks are gathered together; and
truly I used to think Ashestiel was very much like the tent of Paribanou, in the Arabian
Nights, that suited alike all numbers of company equally; ten people fill it at any time,
and I remember its lodging thirty-two without any complaint."</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking of a species of his visitors at this time&mdash;'the go-about folks, who generally
pay their score one way or other'&mdash;he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I never heard of a stranger that utterly baffled all efforts to engage him in conversation,
excepting one whom an acquaintance of mine met in a stage-coach. My friend,
who piqued himself on his talents for conversation, assailed this tortoise on all hands,
but in vain, and at length descended to expostulation. 'I have talked to you, my friend,
on all the ordinary subjects&mdash;literature, farming, merchandise&mdash;gaming, game-laws,
horse-races&mdash;suits at law&mdash;politics, and swindling, and blasphemy, and philosophy;
is there any one subject that you will favor me by opening upon?' The wight writhed his
countenance into a grin: 'Sir,' said he, 'can you say any thing clever about <i>bend-leather</i>?'
There, I own, I should have been as much nonplussed as my acquaintance;
but upon any less abstruse subject, I think, in general, something may be made of a
stranger, worthy of his clean sheets, and beef-steak, and glass of port."</p></blockquote>

successive 'parts' of the American edition. 'Part Four' is in course of publication,

<h2><a name="EDITORS_TABLE" id="EDITORS_TABLE">EDITORS' TABLE.</a></h2>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Siste 'Viator!</span>'&mdash;But a little while ago, we published in these pages a brief tribute
to the memory of a gifted and distinguished female contributor to the poetical department
of this Magazine; and it now becomes our painful duty to record the recent
demise of another child of song, with whom our readers have not unfrequently held
pleasant communion. We gather from a letter before us, from an attentive literary
friend, now in Massachusetts, that <span class="smcap">J. Huntington Bright, Esq.</span> died recently at Manchester,
(Miss.,) at the early age of thirty-three. He was the only son of <span class="smcap">Jonathan
Bright, Esq.</span>, of Salem, (Mass.) Early in life he came to this city, where he resided
until the death of his parents, when he removed to Albany, and subsequently to Norfolk,
(Va.,) where he married. Last autumn he sailed for New-Orleans; and, soon after
his arrival, was induced to ascend the Mississippi, to take part in an important mercantile
interest at Manchester, a new town, hewn but recently from the forest. Here,
undue exposure to the night air brought on the fever of the country; and in this cheerless
frontier region, away from his kindred and friends, after an illness of a few hours, he
yielded up his gentle spirit. There is an irrepressible melancholy in the thought, that
one so open to all the tender influences of affection, should breathe his last far from the
endearments of home, and lay his bones among strangers. Yet, to adopt a stanza of
a charming fragment written by him for the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>:</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Yet it matters not much, when the bloom is fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the light is gone from the lustrous eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sensitive heart is cold and dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the mouldering ashes are left to lie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It matters not much, if the soaring mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like the flower's perfume, is exhaled to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That its earthly shroud should be cast behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To decay, wherever a place is given.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span>, under the signature of '<span class="smcap">Viator</span>,' has contributed many gems of pure
feeling, imbued with the true spirit of poetry, to the fugitive literature of the day. The
'Albany Argus' gave to the world many of his choicest effusions, previous to his appearance
before our readers. Of his later efforts, it is unnecessary to speak. They will
recommend themselves to every affectionate and sympathetic heart, not less by the
graces of composition, than the spirit which pervades them. When the depressing
influences which have so seriously affected the book-market shall cease to be operative,
we hope to see a volume of poetry collated from the literary remains of Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span>;
and we cannot doubt that it will be well received by the public at large, as it will certainly
be most acceptable to his numerous friends and admirers.</p>

<p>We are confident that Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span> was capable of even higher and more sustained
flights than characterize any of the fine productions which he has given to the public.
There was promise of <i>varied</i> endowments, too, of which we had scarcely deemed him
possessed. Parts of the 'Vision of Death,' published in these pages, would have done
no discredit to our best poets. The reader will recall its wild, German-like air, from the
opening stanzas:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The moon rode high in the Autumn sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stars waned cold and dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While hoarsely the mighty Oregon<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pealed his eternal hymn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the prairie-grass bent its seedy heads<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far over the river's brim.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'An impulse I might not defy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Constrained my footsteps there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When through the gloom a red eye burned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a fixed and steady glare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a huge misshapen form of mist<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Loom'd in the midnight air.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon what tender filaments the fabric of existence hangs! Death, an unseen spectre,
walked by the far-travelling poet's side; and when he deemed the journey of life but
just begun, '<i>Siste Viator!</i>' rang in his dying ear. Well did Sir Thomas Browne
exclaim, 'Our life is indeed but short, a very dream; and while we look about, eternity
is at hand!'</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span> has left an amiable and accomplished wife, with two pledges of an affectionate
union. May the blessing of the widow and the fatherless be theirs, in full fruition!&mdash;and
may consolation in bereavement be found in the reflection, that, to use the
beautiful language of the dear departed,</p>

<div class="cpoem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Though his bowed head be with Death's blossoms decked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm in the smile of God his spirit walks erect.'<br /></span>

<p class="center">THE DEBUT OF MISS HILDRETH.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'And smooth success be strew'd before thy feet.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Antony and Cleopatra.</span></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the close of the late summer season, at the Park Theatre, a young lady from
Massachusetts, of about the age of eighteen years, made her 'first appearance on any
stage,' as the play-bills phrase it, in the character of 'The Wife of Mantua.'</p>

<p>We learn from authentic sources, that this was by no means the ordinary case of a
stage-struck-heroine, gratifying a long-indulged desire to dash upon the boards, with the
fond anticipation of achieving immortal renown at a stroke. Nor was it necessity
which drove the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutante</i> to the choice of a profession, in which every department is so
full of toil, and often of unrequited labor and suffering. Of good family, and having an
excellent education, she was early smitten with the love of poetry, especially that of
the better and the elder bards; and contracted a habit of reading aloud, which developed,
gradually, the talent of expressive and forcible recitation, to a degree which astonished
and deeply interested her friends. This talent, strengthened with her increasing knowledge
of books and its exercise, led her to think of the histrionic profession as one congenial
with her feelings, and enabling her to give such utterance to her appreciations of
her favorite poets, as would gratify her own ambition, and that of her friends for her.
But of the stage she knew literally nothing, even when this idea found a place in her
imagination. She had seen only two or three plays performed, and had gleaned no
lessons in the art from any fields but those of her own mind and fancy; and from
these, we are happy to predict, she will yet reap an abundant harvest of success and
renown.</p>

<p>Having taken some lessons in 'stage business' of one of the most accomplished
actresses on the Park boards, and recited some passages, as a specimen of her powers,
in the presence of the manager, she was permitted a trial, and chose the night of Mr.
Chippendale's Benefit for her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i>. She had never seen the character she was to
appear in performed, and never fully rehearsed the part, until the very day she came out:
and even then, it was hastily rehearsed, and with reference less to the language than the
positions, attitudes, etc., of the different characters. Thus, and thus only prepared, she
came before a crowded house, to make her first attempt.</p>

<p>Her fine figure, expressive face, and tasteful attire, joined with her modest mien, and
graceful, dignified carriage, struck the audience very favorably, and she was received
with cheering applause. Soon, to these recommendations she added a clear, distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and well-modulated voice, the first articulations of which, though low and somewhat
timidly tremulous, proved the signal for a repetition of the plaudits of the audience. As
the play proceeded, she gained more confidence, though still somewhat constrained, as
was quite obvious, by the novelty of her situation, and soon began to give abundant
evidence of her right to claim still higher praise, in the fine appreciation of the character
she was personating, and in the truth to nature which marked her readings.</p>

<p>Miss Hildreth's performance of Marianna was of course purely an original one.
She had been no play-goer, had seen no acting of any consequence, and had never
witnessed the representation of 'The Wife.' Her faults were only those which the
judicious advice of experienced friends, added to careful study, and a close but not servile
observation of good models, will be found fully adequate to remove. These are
simply, ignorance of stage-business, and of the magic art of by-play, a knowledge of
which comes slowly, with the gradual growth of confidence, and that experience of the
stage which a long acquaintance with it gives, and which enables the histrion to think
not of the audience, but of the character he is personating. In her perfect understanding
of the language set down for her, in the appropriateness of her gesticulation, attitudes,
and articulation, while actually reading her own part, she evinced the possession of all
the primary and fundamental materials of an actress of the first order; and she has
only to work them judiciously, to convince the world, ere long, that ours has not been
an erroneous estimate of her abilities.</p>

<p>A contemporary critic has objected to Miss Hildreth's performance of 'Marianna,' that
she stood with her arms by her side until her cue was given, when, he concedes, she
went through the part allotted to her creditably. This objection, it will be seen, refers to
her 'by-play.' We have already touched on this point; and in support of the criticism,
would instance the interview of 'Marianna' with St. Pierre, when they discourse of their
own native Switzerland. There was none of that exquisite aside-play, (so to speak,)
representing the enthusiastic interest which the Swiss girl is supposed to feel in the
eloquent descant of her countryman upon its beauties; a feature which gives such a
fascinating charm to the personation of the character by Ellen Tree. And was this to
be expected, under the circumstances? The whole scene was new to the young <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutante</i>.
Like ourselves, she too was a looker-on, during that beautiful apostrophe,
(never better uttered than then, by Charles Mason,) and in short, was interested, as we
were, in all the progress of 'the swelling act;' seemingly forgetting that she was to act
while he was acting, and listening even as we were listening, until her cue was given;
and then, wherein did she fail?</p>

<p>Certainly, not in the modest yet firm narration of her love-prompted journey from her
mountain-home to Mantua, nor in the trial scene before the usurping duke, when, to
save herself from brutal violation, she awes the assembled court by threatening 'the
slightest motion of her little hand,' as it held the poisoned vial to her lips. Nor in the
scenes with her confessor, when she so indignantly spurns the imputation of disloyalty
to her lord, and creeps, child-like, to crave accustomed kindness from her ghostly friend,
whose mind has been poisoned by a villain's arts against her; nor in the interview with
St. Pierre, while she is giving utterance to the heart-felt joy which fills her bosom
upon meeting with her countryman; nor, lastly, in the camp scene, where she so nobly
refuses to go back to the trusting bosom of her lord, until he had proved that trust well-founded.
We might give more particular citations of natural and striking points in her
performance of all these scenes, but we forbear. Certainly, we repeat, in none of these
was there aught that looked like failure, so far as her reading and action were concerned;
and in this opinion we are confirmed by the concurrent testimony of many of the most
distinguished members of the profession, who witnessed the début.</p>

<p>With great confidence, then, do we predict a brilliant career for this young lady, in the
profession she has adopted, if she be only true to herself, and uses aright the talents she
possesses. Careful study, observation, experience, and 'careful study,' after all, and
with all the rest, will realize the fondest hopes of her friends, and the proudest of her
own most ambitious anticipations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Park Theatre.</span>&mdash;If an exception to the influence of that mighty incubus which
has borne so heavily upon all trades, business, corporations, and professions, were
demanded, the Park Theatre, in its undisturbed prosperity, would be selected as
the most prominent. Whether from their old love of the drama, or from a desire to
divert their thoughts from the misery that surrounded them without, they have sought
a refuge in the gay illusions of the mimic scene within, the theatre has, through the
entire period of this pecuniary pestilence, met with constant support from a suffering
public. And it is well that such has been the case. It is far better that the mind, depressed
with care, and racked with continued anxiety, should seek, in such rational
recreation as the Theatre affords, a healthy relief, than by shutting out, in gloomy despondency,
all amusement or relaxation, make its great grief to grow by what it feeds
upon. Varied attractions have, during the past season, followed each other in quick
succession. Bright and particular stars have shot their glories across the theatrical
horizon, to the wonder of many, and the admiration of all. New plays, of every variety
of the drama, have been brought forward, some to receive the stamp of approval, and
others of condemnation. Débutantes have strutted their hour, some giving promise of
growing excellence, and others of quick oblivion. So far, so good. The establishment
has been growing rich, and the public have been satisfied with these <em>prominent</em> evidences
of its desire to maintain its old renown.</p>

<p>It would be well, if it were in our power, in looking back upon the past season, to find
that <em>all</em> things had been done, which justice requires to be done, by an establishment so
flourishing as the Park Theatre. But unluckily, there is more left undone, than any
excuse which the management can produce can palliate. We can affirm, without fear
of contradiction, that there is no theatre in the world, whose immediate support, from
the <em>public</em>, can bear comparison with the Park Theatre. No theatre in this country, it
is well known, pretends to boast of the immense and constant patronage of the Park.
The successive bankruptcies of almost every manager who has attempted to direct the
concerns of the principal English theatres, is notorious, and is quite sufficient proof of
their want of support from the public; and among the uncounted and uncountable
theatres of the gayest and most theatrical nation in the world, those that depend upon
their superior attractions for their great names, depend also upon government for their
principal support. In Germany, there is the same dependence; and in Italy, the land
of song, the very hot-bed of musical genius, opera itself does not find its support in the
public alone, but is fostered and encouraged, both by the civil and ecclesiastical authorities.
Such being the enviable situation of the Park Theatre, it is no more than reasonable
to expect from it a just acknowledgment of its incomparable obligations, in the <em>perfection</em>
of every thing belonging to its management and direction. A very brief examination
of its present qualifications, will show whether or not this acknowledgment has
been, or is likely to be, promptly awarded. There is in the stock company of this
theatre, <em>one</em> good comedian, unequalled in America, we <em>know</em>, and unexcelled in any
other country, we <em>believe</em>; one comic actress, without a superior, in the characters of
the veteran dowagers, venerable and doting nurses, ancient spinsters, and old women
generally; one tolerable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">farceur</i>, who would be a comedian, if he would be content to
be natural, and had a sufficient knowledge of the eccentricities of character to be
aware that extravagance is not <em>always</em> their prominent trait. One second comedian for
old men, country-clowns, talkative, officious servants, such as <i>Pedro</i>, in 'Cinderella;'
one 'actress of all work,' especially good in chambermaids, and never bad in any thing
which the paucity of talent among the ladies of this company <em>obliges</em> her to undertake;
two good light comedians, one of them always sufficient for second characters in
tragedy, and the other particularly effective in the heavy villains of opera and melodrama;
one interesting and sensible actress for the ladies of comedy, and never at fault
as a hoyden, or the spoilt miss of a boarding-school;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
one third-rate singer among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
men; one 'ditto ditto' among the women; one infatuated youth, whose pretty face is
regularly disfigured with the paint that goes to make up the faces of 'scape-grace
nephews' or interesting 'lovers' in sentimental farces; one good reader, who plays second
parts in tragedy; one bad reader, and worse actor, who rolls though Shakspeare and
Sheridan with equal effect; one man who does the dukes, and plays the kings, because
he is <em>fat</em>; these, with sundry female chorus-singers, who appear constantly as 'walking
ladies,' and do occasionally a bit of heavy business in tragedy, and several individual
supernumeraries, who are constantly sent on as 'gentlemen,' and being so addressed by
the other characters, endeavor, by all sorts of awkward graces, to stultify the audience
into the belief that they <em>are</em> so&mdash;these, and these alone, constitute the stock-company
of the most liberally-supported metropolitan theatre in the world! Ask where is its
single tragedian, either male or female; its duplicate comedian; its additional actor or
actress, of any character; its capacity, in short, to enact any one tragedy or comedy in
all its parts, and 'echo answers where!' And to <em>manage</em> this inefficient company, seek
for the 'stage-manager,' and if we are not mistaken, he will be found among the things
'that were, but are not.' There are the materials in this city alone, sufficient to furnish
forth a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps dramatique</i> worthy of the Park Theatre. We have shown that the
company <em>needs</em> replenishing, and it should be so replenished that every character in the
drama might have a fitting representative. As the company at present exists, its best
members do double duty; playing both tragedy and comedy, as dire necessity requires;
while its subordinates are constantly forced into characters utterly beyond their
ability even to comprehend, and to shape them even into an outward resemblance of
which, all the efforts of tailors and stage-dressers must prove totally abortive. It is not
proper that Mr. <span class="smcap">John Mason</span> should play both <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>Jeremy Diddler</i>, unless for
his own amusement. It is not reasonable, that the same person who officiates as tragedian,
should be compelled, after 'doing the terrible' in a five-act tragedy, to assist in
executing the comicalities of a broad farce; nor is it more in keeping with the illusion
of theatrical displays, that the identical lady who does the 'heavy business' of tragedy,
should throw aside her robes of dignity, and immediately thereafter come tripping on in
the after-piece, as a coquettish chambermaid. Yet such incongruities have been repeatedly
practised, and must of necessity continue to be so, until the management see
fit to supply their establishment with a full complement of forces.</p>

<p>There are many other things which need reform. The 'wardrobe wants replenishing.'
The orchestra needs both addition and subtraction, as well as the company on the stage.
The police are worse than useless; being notorious for creating more disturbance than
they ever quell. When all these matters are brought to their just propriety, the Park Theatre
will be worthy of the liberal encouragement which the public have shown themselves
disposed to exhibit toward it, and not before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the above was penned, the Park Theatre, after a brief intermission, has reopened,
to commence another, and we hope a prosperous season. The interior of the
house has been much improved, in the decoration and thorough painting which it has
undergone. The new drop-curtain, painted by Mr. <span class="smcap">Evers</span>, is the most prominent addition
to the local ornaments of the house. It represents the well-known picture of the
court, as convened for the trial of Queen Catharine, and is well worthy of the high
reputation of the artist. The likenesses, according to the original picture, by Harlowe,
are generally well preserved. The figure of Mrs. Siddons is perhaps somewhat large
and masculine, but the bold, commanding dignity of her look and action is perfectly
maintained. The portrait of Charles Kemble is true and familiar, even to those of us
who have only seen him when time had somewhat wrinkled his noble front. The face
of John Kemble seems to us, in the copy, more full and round, and the features more
massive, than in the original. Our own lamented Conway presents a figure on the canvass
at the Park, which is hardly justified by Harlowe. His face and person are not as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
we remember them. They are too muscular and broad in their proportions. Conway,
as we knew him, was of a tall figure, but rather delicately than strongly put together.
The other personages do not differ materially from the pictured originals, and are certainly
far superior, as figures, to any that we have ever before seen from the hand of Mr.
Evers. We think, however, that the artist has committed the common fault of crowding
his figures too closely. The frame seems too small for so many <em>tall</em> persons, and
all of them <em>prominent</em>. If the space within the frame were larger, or the figures smaller,
and placed at more reasonable distances, this production would be almost faultless.
The draperies are naturally and gracefully drawn; the coloring, perhaps, a little too
bright and glaring for the chaste and subdued white and gold in which the interior of
the house is dressed. Of the good taste displayed in the coloring and decorations of the
pannels of the boxes, and of the whole interior, from pit to gallery, with the splendid
dome which crowns the regenerated arena of our 'Old Drury,' too much cannot be
said in commendation. A rich propriety characterizes the painting, and ornamental
devices, and the whole reflects abundant credit upon the improved taste of Mr. Evers
and his assistants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hughes</span>, from the London theatres, has taken the leader's chair in the orchestra;
and from the exhibitions which he has already made of his skill, seems destined to fill
it worthily. Our space will not allow us to speak of our old favorite, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharpe</span>,
who made her first appearance here for some years on the opening evening. She was
greeted with a most hearty welcome, and played with all the spirit and vivacity which
formerly characterized her efforts in comedy. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Chippendale</span> also made her
courtesy; and her efforts to please, as Isabella, in the 'Wonder,' were well received.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pathos.</span>&mdash;True pathos is not only one of the most striking but the most durable attributes
of real eloquence. It will live in the heart for years, recurring ever and anon
to the memory, 'mournful and yet pleasant to the soul.' There is nothing so difficult to
feign, as pathos. It is the language of <em>the heart</em>; and while the orator can 'pump up
a feeling' of grandeur or sublimity, and wreak it upon expression, and the bard, under
the influence of an imaginary afflatus, can excite a reader's <em>pity</em> for fanciful misfortune,
yet neither can affect a pathos, which an intelligent auditory or reader will not at once
detect. Of the many scenes or events which have aroused this emotion in our bosom,
since childhood, there is not one which may not be called up from the dark backward of
the past, with the vividness of an occurrence of yesterday.</p>

<p>These thoughts have been awakened, by meeting the following exquisite example of
pathos in an ancient common-place book. Simple as it is, we venture to say there is
not one under whose eye it will fall, who can read it for the first time, or re-peruse
it, without emotion:</p>

"MY MOTHER'S GRAVE.<br />
</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I had a mother once, like you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who o'er my pillow hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissed from my cheek the briny dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And taught my faltering tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then, there came a fearful day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I sought my mother's bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till harsh hands tore me thence away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And told me she was dead!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> was thirteen years since my mother's death, when, after a long absence from my
native village, I stood beside the sacred mound, beneath which I had seen her buried.
Since that mournful period, great changes had come over me. My childish years had
passed away; and with them had passed my youthful character. The world was altered
too; and as I stood at my mother's grave, I could hardly realize that I was the
same thoughtless, happy creature, whose cheek she so often kissed in her excess of tenderness.
But the varied events of thirteen years had not effaced the remembrance of
that mother's smile. It seemed as if I had seen her yesterday&mdash;as if the blessed sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of her voice was then in my ear. The gay dreams of my infancy and childhood were
brought back so distinctly to my mind, that had it not been for one bitter recollection,
the tears I shed would have been gentle and refreshing. The circumstance may seem a
trifling one; but the thought of it, even now, agonizes my heart&mdash;and I relate it, that
those children who have parents to love them, may learn to value them as they ought.</p>

<p>"My mother had been ill a long time; and I had become so much accustomed to her
pale face, and weak voice, that I was not frightened at them, as children usually are. At
first, it is true, I had sobbed violently&mdash;for they told me she would die; but when, day
after day, I returned from school, and found her the same, I began to believe she would
always be spared to me.</p>

<p>"One day, when I had lost my place in the class, and done my work wrong-side-outward,
I came home discouraged and fretful. I went into my mother's chamber. She
was paler than usual&mdash;but she met me with the same affectionate smile that always
welcomed my return. Alas! when I look back, through the lapse of thirteen years, I
think my heart must have been stone, not to have been melted by it.</p>

<p>"She requested me to go down stairs, and bring her a glass of water. I pettishly
asked why she did not call the domestic to do it. With a look of mild reproach, which
I shall never forget, if I live to be a hundred years old, she said, 'And will not my
daughter bring a glass of water for her poor sick mother?'</p>

<p>"I went and brought her the water; but I did not do it kindly. Instead of smiling,
and kissing her, as I was wont to do, I sat the glass down very quick, and left the room.</p>

<p>"After playing a short time, I went to bed, without bidding my mother 'good night;'
but when alone in my room, in darkness and silence, I remembered how pale she looked,
and how her faint voice trembled, when she said, 'Will not my daughter bring a glass of
water for her poor sick mother?' I could not sleep; and I stole into her chamber, to ask
forgiveness. She had just sunk into an uneasy slumber; and they told me I must not
waken her. I did not tell any one what troubled me; but stole back to my bed, resolved
to rise early in the morning, and tell her how sorry I was for my conduct.</p>

<p>"The sun was shining brightly when I awoke, and hurrying on my clothes, I hastened
to my mother's room.</p>

<p>"She was dead! She never spoke to me more&mdash;never smiled upon me again! And
when I touched the hand that used to rest upon my head in blessing, it was so cold it
made me start. I bowed down by her side, and sobbed in the bitterness of my heart.
I thought then I wished I could die, and be buried with her; and old as I now am, I
would give worlds, were they mine to give, could my mother but have lived to tell
me she forgave my childish ingratitude. But I cannot call her back; and when I
stand by her grave, and whenever I think of her manifold kindness, the memory of
that reproachful look she gave me, will 'bite like a serpent, and sting like an adder.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Near this beautiful fragment, in the time-honored receptacle of literary 'things lost
upon earth' to which we have alluded, we find a kindred specimen, in the affecting
'Lines written by an East-India Officer on his Return from India.' They are as old as
the hills, and as lasting; and we still sympathize as deeply and sincerely with the</p>

<span class="i0">Where stranger voices mock his ear,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as when we first read of his desolation of heart, we know not how many years ago.
There is a melting tenderness in his musings, amid the sights and sounds now strange
to his eye and ear, and among the graves of the friends of his youth, who have long since
been 'followed to the house of mourning, and forgotten in the dust,' which is to us irresistibly
touching. We feel the holy sadness of his blighted affection, when he wakes
from dreams of departed years, and the loved ones who blessed his childhood&mdash;dreams
which come to him in a sleep finally won to his bed in the late and troubled night-watches&mdash;and
in alternate joy and bitterness of soul, exclaims:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I see each shade all silvery white,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I hear each spirit's melting sigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turn to clasp those forms of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the pale morning chills mine eye!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We shall never forget a scene in which deep pathos was a principal characteristic,
which we once beheld, at a country church, in one of the thinly-populated, humble
towns of western New-York. A pious clergyman, of the Baptist denomination, whose
'three-score years and ten' had turned his hair to snow, and given to his limbs the
tremulousness of age, was to preach his farewell discourse to his little congregation,
over whom he had presided for nearly half a century. The place itself, and the time,
were accessaries to the 'abiding effect' which was left upon the minds of all who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
present. It was the afternoon of a mild October day, and the sere leaves of the trees
which shaded the church were falling in slow eddies by the open windows. After
recapitulating his long labors among them&mdash;his teachings 'publicly, and from house to
house'&mdash;his attendance upon the marriage festivals of those whom he had afterward
consigned to the grave with bitter tears&mdash;the christenings and funerals he had celebrated&mdash;after
these affectionate reminiscences, which touched an answering chord in
the bosom of every hearer&mdash;he adverted to that day wherein all the actors in the drama
of life must enter at the last scene, to complete and make up the sublime catastrophe,
and warned them to prepare for its momentous solemnities. 'For myself,' said he, 'I
can say&mdash;standing upon a narrow point between two eternities, and looking back upon
a world imperfect and fading, and upon friends dear indeed, but more fleeting still&mdash;that
I account myself as nothing, until I was my Saviour's, and enrolled in the register of
Christ.' And raising his trembling, attenuated hands to heaven, his dim eyes streaming
with tears&mdash;for, though he had struggled against emotion, his feelings now overcame
him&mdash;he repeated these lines, in the most melting cadence:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ere since by faith I saw the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy flowing wounds supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redeeming Love has been my theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shall be till I die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Then</em>, in a nobler, sweeter song,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll sing thy power to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When this poor lisping, faltering tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lies silent in the grave!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The look which followed these touching stanzas&mdash;the subdued emotion, the pious hope,
which beamed in the countenance of the venerable father&mdash;will never fade from the
memory of those who heard him. The heart of the speaker was poured forth; he was
embodied Pathos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New-York Mercantile Library Association.</span>&mdash;We hear, with sincere pleasure, of
the continued success and improvement of this widely-useful institution. A large
increase of its already extended list of members; additions of new and valuable books;
accessions of magazines, and the higher order of periodicals; and ample preparations for
a series of lectures from some of the best minds of the country, are some of the more
prominent indications of the 'high and palmy state' to which we have alluded. Let
but party disaffections be religiously avoided&mdash;let the members but strengthen each
other's hands in the advancement of the great interests of the association&mdash;and the
institution, for whose original foundation we are mainly indebted to the benevolent
efforts of <span class="smcap">William Wood, Esq.</span>, of Canandaigua, will become one of which both our
city and state may be justly proud.</p>

Session of the Royal Academy of Sciences, at Paris, June 15, 1829. By M. Le <span class="smcap">Baron
Fourier</span>, Perpetual Secretary.' Translated from the French, by <span class="smcap">R. W. Haskins, Esq.</span>,
of Buffalo. We regard this as an excellent and compendious history of one of the most
eminent scientific men France has ever produced. It is the tribute of a mind capable of
appreciating the labors of one 'who enlarged the domain of thought, and taught man
the dignity of his being, by unveiling to his view all the majesty of the heavens,' and
whose name the world will not 'willingly let die.' A clear and forcible style assures us
that the original has lost little in the hands of the translator.</p>

Speaking of ears. That was an ingenious and kindred elucidation of a passage of
Scripture, which was given by a Methodist clergyman, of whom we have somewhere
read. 'In those ancient days,' said the divine, 'small crimes were punished by cropping
off the ears; so that it rarely happened, that a large concourse of people could assemble,
without a considerable proportion of them, and oftentimes more, being deprived of their
auricular members. Hence we view, my brethren, the propriety of that frequent remark
of our Saviour, when addressing a mixed multitude, 'He that <i>hath</i> ears to hear, let him
hear!'' It was the same profound biblical critic, who made St Paul's similitude, touching
his late conversion, ('as one born out of due time,') quite level to the comprehension
of his hearers, by explaining, that the apostle 'was undoubtedly a seven-months' child!'
